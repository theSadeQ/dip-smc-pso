\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

This chapter introduces the double-inverted pendulum control problem. The inverted pendulum has been studied extensively in control theory literature \cite{Khalil2002, Utkin1977}.

See Chapter \ref{chap:literature} for a comprehensive literature review.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:intro:motivation}

The control of underactuated systems like the double-inverted pendulum presents significant challenges due to nonlinear dynamics and instability.

\section{Objectives}

The objectives reference Section \ref{sec:intro:motivation} and aim to develop robust sliding mode controllers.
