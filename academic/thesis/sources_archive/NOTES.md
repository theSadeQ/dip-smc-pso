## Khanesar2013 - Cannot Locate

**BibTeX Entry**:
```
@article{Khanesar2013,
  author = {Khanesar, Mojtaba Ahmadieh and Teshnehlab, Mohammad and Shoorehdeli, Mahdi Aliyari},
  title = {Sliding mode control of rotary inverted pendulum},
  journal = {Journal of AI and Data Mining},
  volume = {1},
  number = {2},
  pages = {85--91},
  year = {2013}
}
```

**Problem**: Cannot locate this paper in the Journal of AI and Data Mining.

**Evidence**:
1. Journal website (jad.shahroodut.ac.ir) shows no Volume 1 from 2013
2. Earliest publication on site is Volume 2, 2014
3. Journal may have started publication after 2013

**Alternative Found**:
- Khanesar, M.A., et al. (2007) "Sliding Mode Control of Rotary Inverted Pendulum"
- Published in: 2007 Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation
- Same authors, same topic, but different year and venue

**Recommendation**:
- Verify citation source (where did we get "Journal of AI and Data Mining, 2013"?)
- Consider using the 2007 conference paper instead
- Or mark as "citation not available" in thesis

## Dash2015 - Year Discrepancy

**BibTeX Entry**:
```
@article{Dash2015,
  author = {Dash, P. K. and Patnaik, R. K. and Mishra, S. P.},
  title = {Adaptive fractional integral terminal sliding mode power control...},
  journal = {Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems},
  year = {2018},  // NOTE: Listed as 2018, not 2015
  note = {Cited for PSO-SMC application to power systems}
}
```

**Actual Details**:
- DOI: 10.1186/s41601-018-0079-z (not 0101-0)
- Year: **2018** (not 2015 as key suggests)
- Journal: Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems (SpringerOpen)
- Status: ✓ ACQUIRED

**Note**: BibTeX key says "Dash2015" but paper is from 2018. This is common when preliminary versions or different papers by same author were considered.
