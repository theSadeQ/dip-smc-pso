ENHANCED RIGOR SUPPLEMENT - ADD THIS TO EVERY REMAINING AUDIT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CRITICAL CONTEXT:

Section 4 (Lyapunov Stability) audit found a CRITICAL mathematical error:
- Theorem 4.3 proof assumed β=1 implicitly (control authority)
- Actual value: β≈0.78 from Example 4.1
- Result: Proof claimed $(−β\tilde{K}|s|) + (\tilde{K}|s|) = 0$
- Reality: Sum = $(1-β)\tilde{K}|s| = 0.22\tilde{K}|s| ≠ 0$ (destabilizing!)
- Impact: Proof is INVALID for any system with β≠1

Apply the SAME level of scrutiny to THIS section to catch similar errors.

ENHANCED AUDIT REQUIREMENTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. MATHEMATICAL RIGOR (For equations, proofs, derivations):

   a) List ALL implicit assumptions
      - Don't assume β=1, d=0, or any parameter = nominal value
      - Check if "obviously" canceling terms actually cancel
      - Verify algebra holds for general case, not just examples

   b) Dimensional analysis
      - Check units on both sides of EVERY equation
      - Flag any dimensionally inconsistent terms

   c) Numerical verification
      - Plug example values into theoretical inequalities
      - Verify claimed bounds are satisfied by numerical data
      - Check if examples are representative or cherry-picked

   d) Edge case analysis
      - What if parameters → 0? What if parameters → ∞?
      - What if β≠1? What if disturbances ≠ 0?
      - Are inequalities valid at stated domain boundaries?

2. DATA/RESULTS RIGOR (For numerical claims, statistics, tables):

   a) Trace EVERY numerical claim to source
      - "50.4x degradation" → Show exact calculation
      - "90.2% failure rate" → Verify from raw data
      - "1.82s settling time" → Confirm appears in tables

   b) Statistical validity
      - Sample size sufficient for claimed CI?
      - p-values corrected for multiple comparisons?
      - Effect sizes match "significant" claims?
      - Test assumptions satisfied (normality, etc.)?

   c) Cross-check values
      - Compare numbers in text vs. tables vs. figures
      - Verify percentages sum to 100% where applicable
      - Check mean ± CI makes sense (positive quantities)

   d) Consistency with theory
      - Do experimental results match theoretical predictions?
      - Are controller rankings consistent with Section 4 proofs?
      - Do numerical values satisfy derived bounds?

3. CLAIM VERIFICATION:

   For EVERY claim marked as "critical" in the original audit prompt:

   - Provide step-by-step verification or counterexample
   - If you cannot verify: FLAG AS CRITICAL ISSUE
   - If claim depends on unstated assumption: FLAG IT
   - If calculation method unclear: REQUEST CLARIFICATION

4. CROSS-SECTION CONSISTENCY:

   Check this section against:
   - Section 4 (Lyapunov Stability): Do results match theoretical predictions?
   - Section 6 (Experimental Setup): Do methods match stated protocol?
   - Other sections: Any contradictions in values, terminology, claims?

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (Enhanced)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

In addition to standard audit format, include:

**MATHEMATICAL RIGOR SECTION:**
- List of ALL implicit assumptions found
- List of ALL equations verified dimensionally
- List of ALL numerical values verified against examples
- List of ALL claims traced to source data

**CRITICAL ISSUES (Enhanced):**
For each critical issue, provide:
1. Exact location (section, equation number, line number if possible)
2. What is claimed vs. what is actually true
3. Impact on paper validity (does this invalidate a theorem/result?)
4. Suggested fix (at least 2 options if possible)

**VERIFICATION TABLE:**
Create a table like this:

| Claim | Source | Verified? | Notes |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------|
| "50.4x degradation" | Table X | ❌ / ✅ | Calculation: ... |
| "β=0.78" | Example 4.1 | ✅ | Matches stated value |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**SEVERITY 1 (CRITICAL):** Invalidates proof/result (like Theorem 4.3 β error)
- Mathematical error in proof
- Claim contradicted by data
- Statistical test assumption violated

**SEVERITY 2 (HIGH):** Reduces confidence but doesn't invalidate
- Unclear methodology
- Missing verification for key claim
- Inconsistency between sections

**SEVERITY 3 (MEDIUM):** Quality issue, doesn't affect validity
- Notation inconsistency
- Missing units
- Unclear writing

Flag SEVERITY 1 issues with: ⚠️ CRITICAL - MUST FIX BEFORE SUBMISSION

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

REMEMBER: The goal is to catch errors BEFORE publication. Be skeptical.
Question every "obvious" claim. Verify every number. Check every assumption.

If something looks too good to be true, it probably needs deeper scrutiny.
