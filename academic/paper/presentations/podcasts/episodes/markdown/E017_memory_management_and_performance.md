## Overview

This episode covers memory management and performance from the DIP-SMC-PSO project.

## HIL Architecture Overview

**Network-Based Plant-Controller Separation:**

    **Key Benefits:**
    
        - **Hardware testing:** Replace plant server with real robot interface
        - **Network simulation:** Test latency, packet loss effects
        - **Safety validation:** Emergency stop mechanisms
        - **Controller portability:** Same controller code for sim/hardware

## HIL Safety Mechanisms

**Multi-Layer Safety Architecture:**

        - **Physical Limit Checks**
        
            - Cart position: $|x| < 2.0$ m
            - Pole angles: $|\theta_1|, |\theta_2| < \pi/2$ rad
            - Control force: $|u| < 100$ N

        - **Timeout Detection**
        
            - Maximum control latency: 100 ms
            - Heartbeat monitoring (1 Hz)
            - Automatic emergency stop on timeout

        - **Watchdog Timers**
        
            - Control loop must respond within deadline
            - Watchdog reset every successful cycle
            - Trigger emergency stop after 3 missed deadlines

        - **Manual Override**
        
            - Emergency stop button (keyboard interrupt)
            - Graceful shutdown sequence
            - State logging before termination

## HIL Latency Monitoring

**Real-Time Performance Tracking:**

    **Monitored Metrics:**
    
        - **Round-trip time (RTT):** Total communication delay
        - **Controller computation time:** Time to compute control law
        - **Network jitter:** Variance in communication delay
        - **Deadline misses:** Cycles exceeding 100 ms deadline

    **Typical Performance (Local Network):**
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
        \toprule
        **Metric** & **Value** \\
        \midrule
        Mean RTT & 2-5 ms \\
        Max RTT & 8-12 ms \\
        Controller compute time & 0.5-1 ms \\
        Deadline miss rate & <0.1\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}

        Allows occasional deadline misses (≤1\

## HIL Validation Results

**Test Scenarios:**

        - **Local Simulation (Baseline)**
        
            - Both plant and controller on same machine
            - RTT: 1-3 ms, zero packet loss
            - Result: Identical performance to non-HIL mode

        - **Network Latency Injection**
        
            - Added 10 ms, 50 ms, 100 ms delays
            - Controller adapts to latency (predictive compensation)
            - Result: Stable up to 100 ms, degraded performance beyond

        - **Packet Loss Simulation**
        
            - 1\
            - Timeout recovery and state estimation
            - Result: Stable up to 5\

        - **Safety Limit Triggering**
        
            - Deliberately exceeded position/angle limits
            - Emergency stop activated within 1 time step
            - Result: No damage, graceful shutdown logged
