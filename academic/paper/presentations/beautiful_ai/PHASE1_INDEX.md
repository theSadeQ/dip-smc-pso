## Delivery Tips

### General Presentation Guidelines:
1. **Timing Management:** Aim for stated duration ±5 minutes per episode
2. **Analogies First:** Always explain physical intuition before showing equations
3. **Audience Adaptation:**
   - Technical audiences: Spend more time on equations, less on analogies
   - General audiences: Emphasize analogies, minimize equation detail
4. **Interactive Elements:** Add poll questions in Beautiful.ai:
   - E001: "Have you worked with control systems before?"
   - E002: "Are you familiar with Lyapunov stability theory?"
   - E004: "Have you used optimization algorithms?"
5. **Visual Emphasis:** Leverage Beautiful.ai animations for:
   - Particle swarm convergence
   - Marble rolling in bowl
   - Waveform transitions (chattering → smooth)

### Episode-Specific Tips:

**E001 (Project Overview):**
- Start with SpaceX rocket hook to grab attention
- Use broomstick analogy repeatedly to build intuition
- Emphasize automation benefit (360% improvement)
- End with clear "what's next" transition to E002

**E002 (Control Theory):**
- Spend 2x time on Lyapunov marble-in-bowl (foundation for everything)
- Slide surface mountain path requires 3-4 minutes of explanation
- Chattering "sound" analogy resonates with audiences
- Reference back to E001 controllers ("remember the seven brains?")

**E003 (Plant Models):**
- Lagrangian energy approach may be new - use visual energy plots
- Small angle graph (sin vs. θ) is critical - spend time here
- Full nonlinear force diagram needs detailed walkthrough
- Emphasize engineering judgment (when to use which model)

**E004 (PSO Optimization):**
- Bird flock analogy must come first (foundation)
- Multi-objective cost function is key concept - use triangle visual
- Real results slide (360% improvement) is climax - emphasize it
- Convergence curve shows "learning" - make this visual

**E005 (Simulation Engine):**
- Start with "why speed matters" (PSO requires 1500 sims)
- Vectorization concept may be new - use timeline visual
- Numba JIT compilation is "magic" - explain simply
- End with Phase 1 recap to celebrate completion
