**Title:** Plant Models and Dynamics
**Subtitle:** The Physics Engine Behind Our Simulation

**What is a "Plant Model"?**
Mathematical representation of the physical system being controlled
- Input: Force F on cart
- Output: System state (positions, velocities, angles)
- Governs how system evolves over time

**Why It Matters:**
Controllers need accurate predictions to compute correct control
Simulation quality depends on model fidelity

**Three Model Types (Speed vs. Accuracy):**
1. **Simplified DIP** - Linear approximation (fastest, limited range)
2. **Full Nonlinear DIP** - Complete physics (accurate, slower)
3. **Low-Rank DIP** - Reduced-order (balanced speed/accuracy)

**This Episode:** Deep dive into physics, equations of motion, when to use each model

### SPEAKER SCRIPT:
"Welcome to Episode E003 where we dive into the physics behind the double inverted pendulum. In Episodes one and two, we talked about the control algorithms - the brains deciding what force to apply. Now we're going to understand the plant being controlled - the physical system itself and how it responds to that force.

When we say 'plant model,' we mean a mathematical representation of the physical system. It's the equations that describe how the cart and pendulums move in response to forces. The input is the horizontal force F we apply to the cart. The output is the complete system state - positions, velocities, and angles of everything. The plant model governs how the system evolves over time given those inputs.

Why does this matter? Because our controllers need accurate predictions. When the controller computes what force to apply next, it's using an internal model of how the system will respond. If that model is wrong - too simplified or inaccurate - the controller can't perform optimally. Simulation quality depends entirely on model fidelity.

We provide three different plant models, each with different tradeoffs between speed and accuracy. Think of them like quality settings in a video game. The Simplified DIP model uses linear approximations - it's the fastest but only valid for small angles. The Full Nonlinear DIP model has complete physics - it's accurate across all conditions but slower to compute. And the Low-Rank DIP model is a reduced-order approximation - it balances speed and accuracy by keeping only the dominant dynamics.

This episode will unpack the physics behind each model, show you the actual equations of motion, and explain when to use which model for your specific task. Let's get into the mechanics!"

**Title:** Lagrangian Mechanics: The Elegant Shortcut

**Why Not Newton's F=ma Directly?**
Would require solving for ALL internal forces:
- Pin force cart→pendulum 1 (unknown)
- Pin force pendulum 1→cart (unknown)
- Pin force pendulum 1→pendulum 2 (unknown)
- Pin force pendulum 2→pendulum 1 (unknown)
- 12+ equations, 12+ unknowns - just to find motion!

**The Lagrangian Recipe (4 Steps):**
1. **Kinetic energy T** - How much energy is in the motion?
2. **Potential energy V** - How much gravitational energy does the system have?
3. **Form Lagrangian** - L = T - V (single function capturing all dynamics)
4. **Apply Euler-Lagrange equations** - Systematic calculus recipe, NO pin forces needed!

**The Beautiful Result:**
```
M(q)q'' + C(q,q')q' + G(q) = B*u
```
- **M(q)** - Mass/inertia matrix (how mass is distributed)
- **C(q,q')** - Coriolis and centrifugal forces (spinning effects)
- **G(q)** - Gravity vector (angle-dependent pull)
- **Bu** - Control input (force enters through cart)

**The Key Insight:** Lagrange avoids pin forces entirely - focus on energy, not internal glue.

### SPEAKER SCRIPT:
"Before we get to the three model variants, I want to explain WHY we use Lagrangian mechanics rather than Newton's second law directly. This is a question students always ask, and the answer reveals something fundamental about the system.

Imagine trying to analyze this system using Newton's F=ma. You'd need to draw free-body diagrams for the cart, pendulum 1, and pendulum 2 separately. Then figure out all the internal forces - the force the cart exerts on pendulum one's pin joint, the reaction force the pin exerts back on the cart, the force pendulum one exerts on pendulum two's joint, and so on. These pin forces are unknown. You'd end up with a coupled system of 12 or more equations where most of the unknowns are these internal forces you don't even care about. You just want to know how the pendulums move!

Lagrangian mechanics sidesteps this entire problem. The key insight: you don't need to know internal constraint forces if you just focus on energy. Here's the recipe, and it works for any mechanical system.

Step one: calculate total kinetic energy - how much energy is in all the motion? For our system, that includes the cart sliding, plus both pendulums translating through space and rotating simultaneously. Step two: calculate total potential energy - how much gravitational energy? Higher pendulums mean more potential energy. Step three: subtract them to form the Lagrangian - L equals T minus V. This single function captures all the system's dynamics. Step four: apply the Euler-Lagrange equations. This is a systematic calculus recipe, like following a cooking recipe, that automatically produces the equations of motion with no pin forces involved.

After applying this recipe, you get one clean matrix equation. M of q times acceleration, plus C of q and q-dot times velocity, plus G of q, equals B times control force. Every term has a clear physical meaning, and we have four slides coming up to explain each one. This is the foundation of everything in E003."

**Title:** Simplified DIP Model: The Sprinter

**The Big Assumption - Small Angles:**
```
When theta is small (< 5-10 degrees from vertical):
  sin(theta) ≈ theta        (error < 0.1%)
  cos(theta) ≈ 1            (error < 0.1%)
```
This turns nonlinear equations into LINEAR equations - huge computational savings!

**What Gets Simplified:**
- Mass matrix becomes CONSTANT (computed once, never updated)
- No Coriolis/centrifugal terms (dropped as second-order)
- Gravity vector becomes linear in angles
- Result: Simple matrix operations instead of trig every timestep

**Superpowers:**
- **10-100x faster** than full nonlinear model
- **1500 PSO simulations** complete in 2-4 hours instead of days
- **Student-friendly** - equations simple enough to derive by hand
- Perfect for initial prototyping and gain ballparking

**Kryptonite:**
- **Invalid beyond 10 degrees** - approximation breaks completely
- **No swing-up control** - pendulum starting horizontal is completely wrong
- Underestimates nonlinear coupling effects

**Use Case:** PSO optimization, educational demos, rapid prototyping, all operation near upright

### SPEAKER SCRIPT:
"The first model variant is the Simplified DIP - what I like to call the Sprinter. It's built on one elegant assumption that dramatically simplifies the mathematics.

When the pendulum angles are small - within about 5 to 10 degrees of vertical - sine of theta is almost exactly equal to theta itself. The error is less than 0.1 percent. And cosine of theta is almost exactly one. These look like tiny approximations, but their impact on the equations is enormous.

With these substitutions, all the nonlinear trigonometric terms disappear. The mass matrix, which normally changes with every angle update, becomes constant - you compute it once at initialization and never update it. The Coriolis and centrifugal terms, which depend on angle products, are dropped as second-order effects. The gravity vector becomes linear in the angles rather than nonlinear through sine functions. The result is a system of linear equations you can solve with simple matrix operations rather than expensive trigonometry at every timestep.

How fast is this? Ten to one hundred times faster than the full nonlinear model. In practical terms: the PSO optimizer needs to evaluate around 1500 simulations to tune a controller. With the full nonlinear model, that would take multiple days. With the Simplified model, it takes 2 to 4 hours. That's the difference between a practical workflow and an impractical one.

But the Sprinter has real limitations. Once pendulum angles exceed about 10 degrees, the approximation breaks down completely. If you try to simulate swing-up - where the pendulum starts hanging straight down and needs to be swung up to vertical - the simplified model gives you garbage results. The small-angle assumption is violated dramatically.

The rule of thumb: use the Sprinter whenever you need speed and are operating near the upright position. That covers PSO optimization, educational demonstrations, rapid prototyping, and initial controller development. For anything else, you need a different model."

**Title:** Full Nonlinear DIP Model: The Gold Standard

**Complete Equations of Motion:**
```
M(theta)*q'' + C(theta,theta')*theta' + G(theta) = B*F

Where:
  q = [x, theta-1, theta-2] (generalized coordinates)
  M(theta) = mass/inertia matrix (3x3, angle-dependent)
  C(theta,theta') = Coriolis and centrifugal terms
  G(theta) = gravity vector
  B = control input matrix
  F = applied force on cart
```

**Physical Effects Included:**
- **Coriolis Forces**: Arise from rotating reference frames (cause curved motion)
- **Centrifugal Forces**: Outward "fictitious" forces from rotation
- **Gyroscopic Coupling**: Moving pendulum 1 creates reaction forces on pendulum 2
- **Nonlinear Trigonometry**: sin(theta), cos(theta) terms throughout

**Valid Range:** -180 to +180 degrees (full operating range)

**When to Use:**
- Final validation before hardware deployment
- Research paper results (publishable accuracy)
- Testing controllers across large disturbances
- Swing-up scenarios (pendulum starts hanging down)

**Computational Cost:** ~10x slower than simplified, but necessary for rigorous validation

### SPEAKER SCRIPT:
"Now let's talk about the Full Nonlinear DIP model - the gold standard for accuracy. This is the real deal, with complete physics and no simplifying approximations.

The equations of motion have the standard robotics form: M times q-double-dot plus Coriolis terms plus gravity equals control input. Let me break down what each component represents physically.

M is the mass and inertia matrix. It's a 3-by-3 matrix that depends on the current pendulum angles. This captures how the system's effective inertia changes as the pendulums rotate. When both pendulums are hanging straight down, the inertia distribution is different than when they're upright. This matrix accounts for that.

C contains the Coriolis and centrifugal terms. Coriolis forces arise from rotating reference frames - they cause curved motion when things are spinning. If you've ever pushed a merry-go-round and noticed objects curve instead of moving straight, that's Coriolis effect. Centrifugal forces are the outward 'fictitious' forces you feel when rotating - like being pushed outward on a spinning ride. Both effects are significant when the pendulums swing.

G is the gravity vector, pulling the pendulums downward based on their current angles. And B is the control input matrix showing how the applied force F affects the generalized accelerations.

The key physical effects included here are: Coriolis forces from rotation, centrifugal forces pushing outward, gyroscopic coupling where moving pendulum one creates reaction forces on pendulum two through the joint, and nonlinear trigonometry - sine and cosine terms throughout the equations that make the dynamics change dramatically with angle.

This model is valid across the full operating range - minus 180 to plus 180 degrees. That's a complete circle. The pendulum can be hanging straight down, tilted at 45 degrees, perfectly upright, or anywhere in between, and the model is accurate.

When do you use this model? Four scenarios. First, final validation before deploying to real hardware - you want the most accurate simulation possible. Second, generating results for research papers - referees expect rigorous validation. Third, testing controllers across large disturbances where the simplified linear model breaks down. Fourth, swing-up scenarios where the pendulum starts hanging downward and needs to be swung up to vertical.

The computational cost is about 10 times slower than the simplified model. All those trigonometric functions and matrix operations take time. But it's necessary for rigorous validation. When we say 'our controller works,' we mean it works on this model with full nonlinear physics."

### SLIDE CONTENT:
**Title:** Low-Rank DIP Model: The Efficient Pro

**The Core Idea - Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD):**
1. Run the Full Simulator thousands of times → collect "snapshots" of the dynamics
2. Apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to find dominant patterns
3. Discard patterns that contribute <1% of total energy
4. Result: Reduced model that captures 99% of the physics at a fraction of the cost

**Performance:**
- **10-50x faster** than full nonlinear model
- **~2% accuracy loss** vs. full model (for well-trained reduced basis)
- **Real-time capable**: fast enough for HIL millisecond-level updates

**Use Cases (where Simplified breaks down, but Full is too slow):**
- Monte Carlo studies: 1000+ parameter variation simulations
- Large-scale gain sweeps: test 1000 gain combinations
- Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL): real-time plant emulation
- Sensitivity analysis: which parameters matter most?

**Requirement (the catch):**
- Must train on Full Simulator data first (not a drop-in replacement)
- Training data must cover your operating range
- Rare edge cases not in training data may not be captured

**Decision Guide:** Sprinter → prototyping | Full → validation | Efficient Pro → large-scale statistical studies

### SPEAKER SCRIPT:
"The third model variant is the Low-Rank DIP model - the Efficient Pro. It uses a clever mathematical trick to get nearly the accuracy of the full model at nearly the speed of the simplified model.

The technique is called Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, or POD. Here's the idea. First, you run the Full Simulator thousands of times with different initial conditions and controllers, collecting 'snapshot' data of the system behavior. Then you apply Singular Value Decomposition to this snapshot matrix. SVD finds the mathematical 'patterns' that appear most frequently in the motion. You keep the patterns that account for 99 percent or more of the total energy, and discard the rest. The result is a reduced-order model that captures the dominant physics at a fraction of the computational cost.

In practice, this gives you a 10 to 50 times speedup over the full nonlinear model, with only about 2 percent accuracy loss. For most statistical studies, that tradeoff is excellent.

The use cases are specifically where the simplified model breaks down but the full model is too slow. Running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations with parameter variations - checking how robust the controller is to mass uncertainty, friction uncertainty, and so on. Testing 1000 different gain combinations in a large parameter sweep. Hardware-in-the-loop testing where you need millisecond-level real-time updates that the full model can't provide.

The catch: this model requires training. You can't just drop it in as a replacement for the full model without first running the full model to generate training data. The reduced model is only valid for operating conditions covered by its training data. If you train on near-upright operation and then test at large angles, the model won't perform well.

The decision rule is straightforward: Sprinter for prototyping and PSO optimization. Full Simulator for validation and publications. Efficient Pro for large-scale statistical studies where you need thousands of simulations with good accuracy."

**Title:** Mass Matrix and Dynamics: What Each Term Means

**The Complete Equation:**
```
M(q)q'' + C(q,q')q' + G(q) = Bu
```

**M(theta) - The Mass Matrix (3x3, angle-dependent):**
- **Diagonal elements** (M11, M22, M33): Self-inertia
  - M11 = total mass of cart + both pendulums (dragging everything)
  - M22 = rotational inertia of pendulum 1
  - M33 = rotational inertia of pendulum 2
- **Off-diagonal elements** (M12, M13, M23): Coupling
  - M12 = "If I accelerate the cart, how much does that torque pendulum 1?"
  - Depends on cos(theta-1) - strongest coupling when pendulum is vertical
- **Symmetry**: M12 = M21 (Newton's Third Law - action equals reaction)

**C(theta, theta') - Spinning Forces:**
- **Coriolis terms**: velocity cross-coupling (-c12 * sin(theta1-theta2) * theta2-dot)
  - Like being pushed sideways on a spinning merry-go-round
- **Centrifugal terms**: velocity-squared effects (-c1 * sin(theta1) * theta1-dot^2)
  - Like being pushed outward when taking a sharp car turn

**G(theta) - Gravity Vector:**
```
G = [0, -g1*g*sin(theta1), -g2*g*sin(theta2)]
  Cart: no gravity (horizontal motion)
  Pendulums: gravity pulls proportional to sin(angle)
```

**B - Control Input Distribution:**
Force F only directly pushes the cart - pendulums respond indirectly through coupling

### SPEAKER SCRIPT:
"Let's go deeper into the structure of the dynamics equation, because each term has a specific physical meaning that's worth understanding.

The mass matrix M is a 3-by-3 grid that changes with the pendulum angles. The diagonal elements represent self-inertia. M11, the top-left element, is the total mass of the entire system - cart plus both pendulums - because accelerating the cart means dragging everything along with it. M22 is the rotational inertia of pendulum one around its joint. M33 is the rotational inertia of pendulum two.

The off-diagonal elements are the coupling terms - mathematically, they answer questions like 'if I accelerate the cart by 1 meter per second squared, how much torque does that apply to pendulum one?' The answer depends on cos of theta-one - when pendulum one is perfectly vertical, the coupling is strongest. When it's horizontal, the coupling is weaker. That's why the mass matrix changes with angles.

Notice that the matrix is symmetric: M12 equals M21. This is Newton's Third Law in disguise. The effect of the cart on pendulum one is exactly the same magnitude as the effect of pendulum one on the cart. Action and reaction.

The C matrix contains the Coriolis and centrifugal terms. Coriolis forces arise when you have motion in a rotating system - think of trying to walk straight on a spinning merry-go-round. Your path curves even though you're walking straight. That's Coriolis. Centrifugal forces are the outward push you feel when a car takes a sharp turn - you feel pressed against the door. Both of these effects appear in our pendulum system when the links are rotating and moving.

The gravity vector G is simple: zero for the cart because gravity acts vertically and the cart moves horizontally. For pendulum one and two, the gravity torque is proportional to sine of the angle. When the pendulum is vertical, sine is zero and gravity has no torque. When it tilts, sine increases and the gravitational torque pulling it further away from vertical increases.

And B is the control input distribution. The applied force directly pushes only the cart. The pendulums respond indirectly through the coupling captured in the mass matrix."

**Title:** Model Comparison: The Engineering Decision Guide

**Head-to-Head Benchmark (MT-6 Results):**

| Metric | Simplified | Full Nonlinear | Low-Rank (k=10) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Speed (sims/sec) | 450 | 8 | 95 |
| Settling Time | 2.31 s | 2.58 s | 2.54 s |

| Valid angle range | <10° | -180 to +180° | Full (if trained) |

**Observation:** Simplified is optimistic (underestimates). Low-rank achieves 95/450 = 21% of simplified speed with only 2% accuracy loss vs. full.

**Angle Range Validation:**

| Test | Simplified | Full Nonlinear | Low-Rank |
|---|---|---|---|
| Near upright (<5°) | Valid | Valid | Valid |
| Large angles (>10°) | INVALID | Valid | Valid (if trained) |
| Swing-up from 180° | INVALID | Valid | Valid (if trained) |

**Decision Guide:**
- Need swing-up / large angles? → **Full Nonlinear only**
- Publishing research results? → **Full Nonlinear only**
- Running PSO (1500 sims)? → **Simplified (speed critical)**
- Monte Carlo (1000 sims)? → **Low-Rank (accuracy important)**
- Quick prototype / first test? → **Simplified (fast iteration)**

### SPEAKER SCRIPT:
"Let's look at the head-to-head numbers from our MT-6 benchmark to make the model selection decision concrete rather than abstract.

Looking at speed: Simplified runs 450 simulations per second. Low-Rank runs 95 per second. Full Nonlinear runs only 8. The Simplified model is 56 times faster than Full - that's the difference between a 3-minute PSO run and a 3-hour PSO run.

But look at the accuracy. The Full Nonlinear model is our ground truth - 2.58 seconds settling time, 5.1 degrees overshoot. The Simplified model is actually optimistic - it predicts 2.31 seconds and 4.2 degrees because it ignores the nonlinear coupling effects that slow things down. The Low-Rank model is much closer to Full: 2.54 seconds and 4.9 degrees, despite being 12 times faster.

The angle range data is decisive for some use cases. If you're doing swing-up control - starting the pendulum hanging straight down and swinging it to vertical - the Simplified model is simply wrong. Full violation of the small-angle assumption. The Full Nonlinear model is valid across the complete range. Low-rank is valid if you trained it on swing-up data.

The decision logic is straightforward. Does your task involve large angles or swing-up? Full Nonlinear only - no compromise on accuracy. Are you publishing research results? Full Nonlinear only - reviewers expect ground truth. Are you running PSO optimization with 1500 evaluations? Simplified - speed is critical and you're near upright anyway. Are you running Monte Carlo studies with 1000 simulations where accuracy matters? Low-Rank strikes the right balance. Are you just prototyping a new idea? Simplified - fast iteration matters more than precision.

Keep this table handy. These benchmark numbers are reproducible in our codebase."

**Title:** Singularities: When the Math Locks Up

**What Causes Singularities?**
The mass matrix M(theta) becomes ill-conditioned at certain configurations:
- When pendulums align in specific geometric relationships (e.g., both horizontal)
- Physics analog: extending your arm completely - elbow "locks" at full extension
- Consequence: certain motions would require infinite force to achieve

**The Condition Number - Health Check:**
```
kappa = condition number of M
  kappa ~1-100:    Healthy (clean inversion, no issues)
  kappa ~1e6:      Warning (numerical errors amplified)
  kappa -> infinity: Singular (cannot be inverted)

    logger.warning(f"Ill-conditioned: kappa={cond:.2e}")

# Strategy 2: Regularized inversion (add cushion)
M_reg = M + epsilon * np.eye(3)
M_inv = np.linalg.inv(M_reg)

# Strategy 3: Pseudoinverse (most robust)
M_inv = np.linalg.pinv(M, rcond=1e-6)
```

**From config.yaml (thresholds):**
```yaml
stability_monitoring:
  conditioning:
    median_threshold: 1e7   # Warn if median kappa > 1e7
    spike_threshold: 1e9    # Critical spike threshold
    fallback_threshold: 3   # Max pseudoinverse uses per episode
```

**In Practice:** Normal upright operation: kappa ~10-100 (healthy). Near horizontal (critical config): kappa grows. Controller actively avoids these configurations.

### SPEAKER SCRIPT:
"There's a subtle physical phenomenon called a singularity that every DIP implementer needs to understand, because it can cause simulation crashes or numerical garbage if you don't handle it.

Think about extending your arm completely straight. When your elbow is fully locked, you can't push it any further in that direction - the joint geometry has 'locked up.' There's no more range of motion available. The same thing happens with our pendulum system at certain configurations. When both pendulums are nearly horizontal, for example, the mass matrix becomes nearly singular. The physical interpretation: in that configuration, certain accelerations would require infinite force. The geometry simply doesn't allow them.

We measure how close the mass matrix is to singularity using the condition number - think of it as a health score. When the condition number is between 1 and 100, the matrix is healthy - it inverts cleanly with no numerical issues. When it climbs above 1 million, errors start getting amplified. When it approaches infinity, you have a true singularity and the matrix literally cannot be inverted.

We use three strategies to handle this. First, continuous monitoring - at every timestep, compute the condition number and log a warning if it exceeds the configured threshold. This gives you early warning before problems occur. Second, regularized inversion - add a tiny diagonal perturbation, epsilon times the identity matrix, before inverting. This provides numerical cushioning that prevents division-by-near-zero. The solution is slightly less exact but numerically stable. Third, pseudoinverse - the most robust approach, using numpy's pinv function which handles near-singular matrices gracefully.

The configuration file lets you tune these thresholds to match your hardware. A median condition number above 10 million triggers warnings. Spikes above 1 billion are critical. And we track how often the pseudoinverse fallback gets used - more than 3 times per episode suggests the controller is approaching dangerous configurations.

In normal upright operation, the condition number stays around 10 to 100 - comfortably healthy. The risk only appears when pendulums swing toward horizontal, which a well-tuned controller actively avoids anyway."

**Title:** Practical Pitfalls and Validation Workflow

**[PITFALL 1: Wrong Angle Convention]**
Two conventions exist - use the wrong one and all signs flip:
```
Our convention: theta = 0 at UPRIGHT (unstable equilibrium)
  Gravity term: -m*g*l*sin(theta)  [pushes AWAY from vertical]

Alternative: theta = 0 at HANGING (stable equilibrium)
  Gravity term: +m*g*l*sin(theta)  [different sign entirely]
```
Wrong convention = gravity pulls wrong direction = immediate instability

**[PITFALL 2: Inconsistent Units]**
Always use SI units internally - convert only for display:
```python
# WRONG: angles in degrees in simulation
G = -m * g * l * np.sin(np.deg2rad(theta))  # Don't convert mid-flight!

# CORRECT: radians throughout
G = -m * g * l * np.sin(theta)   # theta already in radians
theta_display = np.rad2deg(theta) # Only convert for plots
```

**[PITFALL 3: Ignoring Parameter Bounds]**
Pydantic validator catches unphysical parameters:
```python
@validator('cart_mass')
def validate_cart_mass(cls, v):
    if v <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Mass must be positive")
    # Also warns for unusual values (0.5-10 kg range)
    return v
```

**[TIP 1: Energy Conservation Test]**
Undamped pendulum with no control must conserve energy:
```python
E = [kinetic_energy(s) + potential_energy(s) for s in result.states]
energy_drift = abs(E[-1] - E[0]) / E[0]
assert energy_drift < 0.01  # <1% drift is acceptable
```

**[TIP 2: Cross-Check Models]**
Near upright (<5 degrees), simplified and full models should agree:
```python
theta_diff = np.mean(np.abs(result_simple.theta1 - result_full.theta1))
assert theta_diff < np.deg2rad(1.0)  # <1 degree difference acceptable
```

### SPEAKER SCRIPT:
"Three pitfalls account for the majority of bugs I've seen in DIP implementations. Let me save you the debugging pain.

Pitfall one: wrong angle convention. There are two ways to define zero angle for an inverted pendulum. Our convention uses zero for the upright position - the unstable equilibrium. With this convention, gravity creates a torque that pushes the pendulum AWAY from vertical, so the gravity term has a negative sign. The alternative convention puts zero at the hanging position - the stable equilibrium. If you accidentally mix these conventions - for example, copying gravity computation code from a library that uses the other convention - all your gravity signs are wrong. The pendulum falls away from vertical immediately and nothing makes sense. Check the gravity signs first whenever a new implementation behaves strangely.

Pitfall two: inconsistent units. All internal calculations must use radians. The sin and cos functions in numpy expect radians. If you accidentally pass degrees, you get wildly wrong physics. The rule: convert angles to radians once at input, use radians everywhere internally, convert back to degrees only for display and plots. Never convert mid-computation.

Pitfall three: ignoring parameter bounds. Negative masses, zero lengths, inertia values below the physical minimum for a point mass - these cause numerical nonsense or outright crashes. We use Pydantic validators to catch unphysical parameters at configuration time with clear error messages. If you're adding a new configuration parameter, add a validator.

Now two tips that catch bugs systematically rather than one at a time.

Tip one: energy conservation test. If you disable friction and apply no control force, the total mechanical energy of the system must remain constant - that's conservation of energy. Run this test with your model and verify that energy drift over 10 seconds is less than 1%. If energy isn't conserved, your integration is wrong - wrong timestep, wrong integrator, or wrong dynamics.

Tip two: cross-check models. Near the upright position, within 5 degrees, the simplified and full nonlinear models should give nearly identical results. Run both with the same initial conditions and controller, then compare the trajectories. If they disagree by more than 1 degree, something is wrong with one of them. This test catches sign errors, unit errors, and parameter mismatches."

### SPEAKER SCRIPT:
"Let's recap what you've learned about plant models and dynamics.

First, three plant models with different tradeoffs. Simplified for speed during PSO optimization. Full nonlinear for accuracy when validating results. Low-rank for balanced performance in Monte Carlo statistical studies. Each has its place in the workflow.

Second, Lagrangian mechanics gives us an elegant energy-based approach. Instead of drawing free-body diagrams and balancing forces, we compute kinetic and potential energies, form the Lagrangian as T minus V, and apply Euler-Lagrange equations. The math handles all the complexity automatically - no need to track internal pin forces.

Third, the standard dynamics form M-q-double-dot plus C plus G equals B-u captures all the physics in a clean, modular structure. Each term has clear physical meaning: mass matrix for inertia, Coriolis for spinning forces, gravity vector for angle-dependent pull.

Fourth, singularities are physical locking at certain geometric configurations. The condition number is your health check - stay in the 1 to 100 range, and use the three handling strategies if you approach danger.

And fifth, engineering judgment guides model selection. Use the simplified model for PSO where you need thousands of fast simulations. Use the full model for validation and publications. Use low-rank for statistical studies. Choose based on your specific task requirements - as I said, don't use a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

How does this connect to the controllers we studied in episode two? Controllers use internal plant model predictions when computing control actions. Model accuracy directly affects control performance. The good news is that robust controllers like sliding mode control handle model uncertainties automatically - they don't need perfect models to work.

What's next? Episode four dives into Particle Swarm Optimization - the intelligent tuning method that automatically finds optimal controller gains. We'll see how nature-inspired algorithms achieve 360% performance improvements over manual tuning. We're moving from understanding physics to intelligent automation. See you in E004!"
