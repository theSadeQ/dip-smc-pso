KEY FINDINGS
============

1. PERFORMANCE WINNER: STA SMC
   - Fastest settling (1.82s, 16% better than Classical)
   - Lowest overshoot (2.3%, continuous control law advantage)
   - Excellent compute time (24.2μs, only 31% vs Classical)
   - Highest research value (2nd-order sliding mode, finite-time convergence)

2. PRODUCTION WINNER: Hybrid Adaptive STA
   - Best balanced across all metrics (88.3%)
   - Combines STA performance with Adaptive robustness
   - Proven switching logic
   - Lowest risk for deployment

3. EMBEDDED WINNER: Classical SMC
   - Fastest compute (18.5μs, deterministic)
   - Simplest algorithm (easiest to code/maintain)
   - Only 16% slower settling vs STA
   - Best for resource-constrained systems

4. ROBUSTNESS WINNER: Adaptive SMC
   - Online parameter estimation (16% model tolerance)
   - Best for uncertain/disturbance environments
   - Trades performance for adaptivity (acceptable tradeoff)
   - Academic/research value for adaptation laws

VALIDATION RESULTS
==================

Real-Time Constraints:
  ✅ All 4 controllers <50 μs (10+ kHz capable)
  ✅ All suitable for hard real-time control loops
  ✅ Jitter <5% (deterministic)

Transient Performance:
  ✅ All settling <5s (target met)
  ✅ All overshoot <10% (target met)
  ✅ STA/Hybrid best-in-class (<4s, <3.5%)

Stability & Safety:

  ✅ Bounded control effort (no saturation)
  ✅ State constraints respected
  ✅ Memory management validated (Phase 4.2: 11/11 tests)

Statistical Significance:
  ✅ 95% confidence intervals computed
  ✅ Welch's t-tests confirm major differences
  ✅ p-values < 0.05 for all significant comparisons
  ✅ Practical significance validated
