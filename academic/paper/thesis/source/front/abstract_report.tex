This report presents the design, implementation, and performance analysis of sliding mode control (SMC) for double-inverted pendulum (DIP) stabilization. Four SMC variants are developed: classical SMC, super-twisting algorithm (STA-SMC), adaptive SMC, and hybrid adaptive STA-SMC. Controller gains are optimized using particle swarm optimization (PSO) to minimize settling time, overshoot, energy consumption, and chattering. Comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate that PSO-optimized hybrid adaptive STA-SMC achieves 40\% faster settling, 70\% reduced chattering, and robust performance under $\pm$30\% model uncertainty compared to classical SMC. All controllers are validated through simulation and benchmarked against baseline performance metrics. Implementation is provided as open-source software for reproducibility.
