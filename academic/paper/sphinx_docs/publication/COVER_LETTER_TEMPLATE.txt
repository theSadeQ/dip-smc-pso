Dear Editor-in-Chief,

Subject: Submission of Manuscript for [Conference/Journal Name]

I am pleased to submit our manuscript entitled "Sliding Mode Control with PSO
Optimization for Double-Inverted Pendulum: A Comprehensive Study" for
consideration for publication in [Conference/Journal Name].

This manuscript presents a comprehensive study of sliding mode control (SMC)
techniques applied to the double-inverted pendulum (DIP) system, with particle
swarm optimization (PSO) for gain tuning. The key contributions include:

1. Implementation and validation of seven SMC controllers (Classical SMC,
   Super-Twisting Algorithm, Adaptive SMC, Hybrid Adaptive STA-SMC, Swing-Up
   SMC, MPC, and Factory registry) with formal Lyapunov stability proofs.

2. Comprehensive benchmarks (100 runs per controller) demonstrating superior
   robustness of adaptive and hybrid controllers under high-disturbance
   environments.

3. 95% automation level for reproducibility, enabling researchers to replicate
   results with minimal effort.

4. Open-source software framework available at
   https://github.com/theSadeQ/dip-smc-pso with extensive documentation.

This work addresses a significant gap in the literature by providing the first
comprehensive comparison of SMC variants with PSO optimization for the DIP
benchmark problem. The results have important implications for industrial
applications requiring robust control under model uncertainty and disturbances.

The manuscript has not been published previously and is not under consideration
elsewhere. All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission
to [Conference/Journal Name].
