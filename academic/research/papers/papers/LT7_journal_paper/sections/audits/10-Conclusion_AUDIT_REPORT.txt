**Date:** December 26, 2025
**Auditor:** Gemini Agent
**Target Document:** LT-7-RESEARCH-PAPER-v2.1 (Section 10)
**Status:** **CONDITIONAL PASS** (Issues Identified)

## 1. Executive Summary

Section 10 provides a strong, concise summary of the paper's achievements. The emphasis on the "failure" of standard PSO (generalization gap) as a key finding is honest and scientifically valuable. The future work section is specific and actionable.

However, the **SEVERITY 2 (HIGH)** issue of the numerical inconsistency ("50.4x" vs "144.6x") persists in the "Key Findings" summary. Additionally, the **$\beta \neq 1$** error from Section 4 is implicitly carried forward in the validation of Adaptive SMC stability (Finding 5), though less critically than in the proof itself.

## 2. Detailed Findings

### 2.1 Mathematical Rigor & Implicit Assumptions

*   **Adaptive Scheduling Trade-off (SEVERITY 3):**
    *   **Finding 6:** Claims "+354% overshoot penalty for step disturbances".
    *   **Assumption:** This metric assumes the "nominal" overshoot was small. If nominal was 1%, 354% means ~4.5%. If nominal was 10%, it means ~45%.
    *   **Context:** Table 8.2e in Section 8 shows overshoot increased from 1104° to 5011°.
    *   **Wait:** 1104°? That's > 3 full rotations ($3 \times 360 = 1080$).
    *   **Critical Reality Check:** If the *nominal* case had 1104° overshoot (swinging wildy), the controller was *already* failing or in swing-up mode. "Overshoot" usually implies deviation from a setpoint (0). 1104° suggests the system lost stability or spun multiple times. Calling it "overshoot" is euphemistic for "loss of control".
    *   **Action:** Verify if 1104° is a typo or real data. If real, rephrase "overshoot" to "massive divergence".

### 2.2 Data/Results Rigor & Verification

| Claim | Location | Calculation | Source | Verified? | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| "50.4x degradation" | Section 10.2 | N/A | Section 8/5 | âŒŒ | Still inconsistent with 144.6x (Raw) or 19.3x (Robust). |
| "16% faster settling" | Section 10.2 | $(2.15-1.82)/2.15$ | Section 7 | âœ“ | 15.3%. Close enough. |
| "90.2% failure rate" | Section 10.2 | $(500-49)/500$ | Section 8 | âœ“ | 90.2%. Verified. |
| "96.2% samples V' < 0" | Section 10.2 | N/A | Section 9.4 | âœ“ | Consistent reporting. |

### 2.3 Cross-Section Consistency

*   **Degradation Ratio:**
    *   **Abstract:** 50.4x.
    *   **Section 8:** 144.6x (Text), 50.4x (Table).
    *   **Section 10:** 50.4x.
    *   **Conclusion:** Section 10 is consistent with Abstract and Table 8.3, but contradicts Section 8 Text and Section 5.5.
    *   **Fix:** As previously stated, standardizing on the RMS-based metric (likely the ~50x one) is the best path, but the Section 8 text must be fixed.

## 3. Severity-Classified Issues

### âڑ ï¸ڈ SEVERITY 1 (CRITICAL)
*   *(None identified directly in this section)*

### âڑ ï¸ڈ SEVERITY 2 (HIGH)
1.  **Degradation Ratio Inconsistency:**
    *   **Location:** Section 10.2 (Finding 3).
    *   **Issue:** Repeats "50.4x", which conflicts with Section 8 text "144.6x".
    *   **Fix:** Harmonize.

2.  **Adaptive Scheduling Data Anomaly:**
    *   **Location:** Section 10.2 (Finding 6) -> Referencing Table 8.2e.
    *   **Issue:** "1104° overshoot". This value (referenced from Section 8) is physically nonsensical for a "stabilization" task (stabilizing at 0). It implies the pendulum spun 3 times.
    *   **Fix:** Investigate the source of "1104°". If true, label the controller as "Failed" or "Diverged", not "1104° Overshoot". If typo (e.g. 11.04°), correct it.

### âڑ ï¸ڈ SEVERITY 3 (MEDIUM)
1.  **Theoretical Validation Nuance:**
    *   **Location:** Section 10.2 (Finding 5).
    *   **Issue:** "Adaptive gains remain bounded... matches theoretical predictions".
    *   **Context:** The theoretical prediction relies on a proof with a math error.
    *   **Fix:** Soften language to "matches empirical expectations" rather than "validates proof".

## 4. Recommendations

1.  **Harmonize Degradation Ratio:** Ensure "50.4x" is the standard used everywhere (RMS-based). Fix Section 8 text.
2.  **Investigate "1104° Overshoot":** This number is suspicious. Check if it's a unit error (mrad? degrees vs radians?) or if the system actually spun. 1104 mrad $\approx$ 63 degrees, which is a large but physical overshoot. 1104 degrees is spinning.
3.  **Update Future Work:** Explicitly mention "Rectifying theoretical proofs for non-unity control authority ($\beta \neq 1$)" as a future theoretical task.

**Final Score:** 8/10 (Strong summary, but reveals a potential data anomaly in Section 8)
