# AUDIT REPORT: Section 8 - Robustness Analysis

**Date:** December 26, 2025
**Auditor:** Gemini Agent
**Target Document:** LT-7-RESEARCH-PAPER-v2.1 (Section 8)
**Status:** **CONDITIONAL PASS** (Issues Identified)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Section 8 provides a deep dive into the robustness of the controllers. The analysis of failure modes and the "cliff-like" degradation is insightful. The introduction of "Robust PSO" is a strong methodological contribution.

However, the audit identified **SEVERITY 2 (HIGH)** issues with the "Degradation Ratio" consistency (again, the 50.4x vs 144.6x vs 49.3x issue is pervasive) and **SEVERITY 3 (MEDIUM)** issues with the "Robustness Score" metric being undefined in the text (though present in tables). The **$\beta 
eq 1$** issue from Section 4 subtly affects the *interpretation* of the parameter tolerance limits (Section 8.1), as the theoretical predictions (Figure 8.1) likely assumed $\beta=1$.

## 2. Detailed Findings

### 2.1 Mathematical Rigor & Implicit Assumptions

*   **Robustness Score Definition (SEVERITY 3):**
    *   **Table 8.1:** "Robustness Score: 30.0 / 100".
    *   **Issue:** The formula for this score is not defined in Section 8. Section 6.5 defines a "Robustness Score $R = p_{conv} 	imes (1 - OS/180)$". If $p_{conv}=0$ (Nominal Success=0%), then $R=0$. Why is it 30.0?
    *   **Note 1:** Text explains "reflects baseline failure, not model uncertainty". This implies a "floor" value was assigned manually? This methodology is unclear.

*   **Theoretical Prediction Validity:**
    *   **Figure 8.1:** "Predicted Tolerance: 16%".
    *   **Origin:** Based on Lyapunov analysis.
    *   **Assumption:** Did the Lyapunov analysis assume $\beta=1$? If so, the prediction is optimistic. If $\beta=0.78$, the effective gain is lower, so the margin for parameter error (which reduces effective gain further) is smaller.
    *   **Impact:** The "16%" prediction might be an overestimate. The text acknowledges these are "PREDICTED values... pending validation".

### 2.2 Data/Results Rigor & Verification

| Claim | Location | Calculation | Source | Verified? | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| "50.4x degradation" | Abstract/Text | N/A | Section 5.5 | â‌Œ | Section 5.5 says 144.6x. Section 8.3 Table says 50.4x. **Conflict.** |
| "144.59x degradation" | Section 8.3 | $(115291-797)/797$ | Section 8.3 Text | âœ“ | Internal consistency within the "Validation Results" subsection. |
| "90.2% failure rate" | Section 8.3 | $(500-49)/500$ | Table 8.3 | âœ“ | $451/500 = 90.2\%$. Verified. |
| "7.5x improvement" | Section 8.3 | $144.59/19.28$ | Section 8.3 Text | âœ“ | Verified. |
| "21.4% improvement" | Table 8.2b | $(11.489-9.031)/11.489$ | Table 8.2b | âœ“ | $2.458/11.489 = 21.39\%$. Verified. |

### 2.3 Cross-Section Consistency

*   **Degradation Ratio Chaos (SEVERITY 2):**
    *   **Table 8.3:** Reports "107.61" chattering index for MT-7 Test. Degradation "50.4x".
    *   **Text below Table 8.3:** Reports "115,291" chattering for Standard PSO. Degradation "144.59x".
    *   **Conflict:** Table 8.3 and the Text *immediately below it* use completely different numbers (100 vs 100,000 magnitude).
    *   **Hypothesis:** Table 8.3 uses the "RMS" metric (N/s). The text uses the "Sum Squared" metric (raw).
    *   **Fix:** **MANDATORY:** Standardize units. Convert everything to RMS (N/s) or everything to Raw. RMS is physically meaningful; Raw is not (depends on duration). Use RMS.

## 3. Severity-Classified Issues

### âڑ ï¸ڈ SEVERITY 1 (CRITICAL)
*   *(None identified, assuming the $\beta$ issue is fixed globally)*

### âڑ ï¸ڈ SEVERITY 2 (HIGH)
1.  **Massive Unit Inconsistency in Section 8.3:**
    *   **Location:** Table 8.3 vs Validation Results Text.
    *   **Issue:** Table reports Chattering $\approx 100$. Text reports $\approx 100,000$. This confuses the reader about the scale of failure.
    *   **Fix:** Convert the "Validation Results" text to use the RMS metric used in the Table (or vice-versa). RMS is preferred.
    *   **Degradation Ratio:** 50.4x (Table) vs 144.6x (Text). The ratio itself changes because the metrics scale differently (RMS is $\sqrt{Sum}$). $\sqrt{144} 
approx 12$. 50x is not $\sqrt{144}$. This implies linear scaling vs quadratic scaling differences.
    *   **Action:** Re-calculate ratios using consistent units.

### âڑ ï¸ڈ SEVERITY 3 (MEDIUM)
1.  **Robustness Score "Floor":**
    *   **Location:** Table 8.1.
    *   **Issue:** Score "30.0" appears arbitrary for a failed controller.
    *   **Fix:** Define the floor logic (e.g., "Minimum score 30 assigned for algorithm existence"). Or change to "0.0 (Failed)".

---

## 4. Recommendations

1.  **Standardize Chattering Units (Global Fix):** Decide on **RMS (N/s)** as the single truth. Update Section 5.5, Section 8.3 text, and Abstract to reflect the RMS-based degradation ratio.
    *   If Table 8.3 (RMS) says 50.4x, use **50.4x** everywhere.
    *   Delete the "144.6x" claim derived from raw sum-squared errors, as it exaggerates the effect (quadratic scaling).
2.  **Clarify Theoretical Robustness:** Add a note to Figure 8.1 that predictions assume $\beta=1$ and actual tolerance might be lower due to reduced control authority.
3.  **Define Robustness Score:** Add a footnote to Table 8.1 explaining the "30.0" baseline.

**Final Score:** 7/10 (High quality analysis, marred by unit inconsistency)
