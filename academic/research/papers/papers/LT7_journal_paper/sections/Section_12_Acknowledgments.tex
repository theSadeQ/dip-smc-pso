\section{Acknowledgments}

This research was conducted as part of the Double-Inverted Pendulum SMC with PSO project. The authors acknowledge the open-source community for providing foundational libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib) and tools (Python, pytest) that enabled this work.

Code Availability: All simulation code, controller implementations, and benchmarking scripts are publicly available at https://github.com/theSadeQ/dip-smc-pso.git under MIT License.

Data Availability: Complete experimental data, PSO optimization results, and statistical analysis outputs are included in the repository's benchmarks/ directory with SHA256 checksums for reproducibility verification.

Reproducibility: This work adheres to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). All simulations use deterministic seeding (seed=42) and pinned dependency versions (requirements.txt). Reproduction instructions are provided in README.md.
