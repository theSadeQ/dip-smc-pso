\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of seven sliding mode control (SMC) variants for stabilization of a double-inverted pendulum (DIP) system. We evaluate Classical SMC, Super-Twisting Algorithm (STA), Adaptive SMC, Hybrid Adaptive STA-SMC, Swing-Up SMC, Model Predictive Control (MPC), and their combinations across multiple performance dimensions: computational efficiency, transient response, chattering reduction, energy consumption, and robustness to model uncertainty and external disturbances. Through rigorous Lyapunov stability analysis, we establish theoretical convergence guarantees for each controller variant. Performance benchmarking with 400+ Monte Carlo simulations reveals that STA-SMC achieves superior overall performance (1.82s settling time, 2.3% overshoot, 11.8J energy), while Classical SMC provides the fastest computation (18.5 microseconds). PSO-based optimization demonstrates significant performance improvements but reveals critical generalization limitations: parameters optimized for small perturbations (±0.05 rad) exhibit 50.4x chattering degradation and 90.2% failure rate under realistic disturbances (±0.3 rad). Robustness analysis with ±20% model parameter errors shows Hybrid Adaptive STA-SMC offers best uncertainty tolerance (16% mismatch before instability), while STA-SMC excels at disturbance rejection (91% attenuation). Our findings provide evidence-based controller selection guidelines for practitioners and identify critical gaps in current optimization approaches for real-world deployment.
