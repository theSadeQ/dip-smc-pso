# Publication Figures

Publication-ready plots and visualizations from benchmark analysis.

## Directory Contents

This directory contains PNG/PDF figures generated from benchmark data for:
- Research papers and technical reports
- Documentation and presentations
- Performance comparison visualization

## Figure Generation

Figures are generated by analysis scripts:
- Source data: `benchmarks/raw/` and `benchmarks/processed/`
- Generation scripts: `scripts/analysis/`, `scripts/research/`
- Visualization modules: `src/benchmarks/comparison/`

## Usage in Research

When citing figures in research papers, refer to their source data in `benchmarks/raw/`
to ensure reproducibility. All figures can be regenerated from raw benchmark outputs.

## Preservation Policy

This directory path (`benchmarks/figures/`) is preserved for backward compatibility
with existing documentation and research references. Do not move or rename.
