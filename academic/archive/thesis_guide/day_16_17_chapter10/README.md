# DAYS 16-17: Chapter 10 - Controller Performance Comparison

**Time**: 16 hours over 2 days
**Output**: 18-20 pages
**Difficulty**: Moderate (mostly narration of data)

---

## OVERVIEW

Days 16-17 present the main results: comparing all 7 controllers on baseline performance metrics (settling time, overshoot, control effort, chattering).

**Why This Matters**: This is THE results chapter. Readers will judge your entire thesis based on how well you present these comparisons.
