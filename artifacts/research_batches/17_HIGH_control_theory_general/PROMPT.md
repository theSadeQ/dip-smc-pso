I need academic citations for control theory general claims in a control systems research project (Double Inverted Pendulum with Sliding Mode Control and PSO Optimization).

**Context:** These claims describe control theory general implementations and theoretical foundations. I need authoritative citations to support each claim.

**Output Format Required:**
For EACH claim below, provide EXACTLY this format:

```
CLAIM X (ID: [claim_id]):
- Citation: Author (Year)
- BibTeX Key: firstauthor_year_keyword
- DOI: [DOI or "N/A" if book/unavailable]
- Type: journal/conference/book/arxiv
- Note: [1-2 sentences explaining why this citation fits this specific claim]
```

**Suggested Starting References:**
- [Research relevant authoritative sources for this topic]


**Important Guidelines:**
1. **Prioritize authoritative sources:**
   - Top-tier journals: IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, Automatica, Control Engineering Practice
   - Seminal textbooks: Slotine & Li, Khalil, Utkin, etc.
   - Landmark conference papers: CDC, ACC, IFAC

2. **For theorems/lemmas:** Cite the ORIGINAL paper where the theorem was first proven, not surveys or textbooks (unless the textbook is the original source)

3. **For implementations:** Cite the source that best describes the specific technique used (e.g., boundary layer â†’ Slotine & Li Ch. 7)

4. **If uncertain:** Suggest 2-3 alternative citations and note why each might be appropriate

5. **BibTeX keys:** Use format `firstauthor_year_keyword` (e.g., `slotine1991applied`, `levant2003higher`)
