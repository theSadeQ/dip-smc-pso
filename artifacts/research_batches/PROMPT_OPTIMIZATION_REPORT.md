# ChatGPT Prompt Optimization Report

**Optimization Date:** 2025-10-03
**System:** Citation Research Batch Generation
**Optimizer:** Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)

---

## Executive Summary

Implemented software pattern filtering to eliminate wasted time on non-research claims in ChatGPT citation prompts.

**Key Results:**
- **Batch 12:** 100% of claims filtered (17/17) → 3.4 hours saved
- **Efficiency Gain:** Up to 100% reduction in research time for affected batches
- **Quality Improvement:** Focus only on theoretical claims requiring academic citations

---

## Problem Identified

### Original Issue

Batch 12 (`12_HIGH_benchmarking_performance`) contained 17 claims, but analysis revealed:

| Category | Count | Issue |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Malformed Claims** | 13 | "None (attributed to: None)" - parsing errors |
| **Software Patterns** | 3 | Factory/Strategy patterns, utility classes |
| **Implementation Details** | 1 | Code wrappers, not theory |
| **Valid Claims** | 0 | Zero research claims |

**Time Waste:** 17 claims × 12 min/claim = **204 minutes (3.4 hours) of wasted effort**

### Root Cause

The claim extraction system (`code_extractor.py`) was:
1. Extracting from ALL docstrings with keywords
2. Not distinguishing software patterns from theoretical claims
3. Creating malformed claims from incomplete text
4. Including generic module descriptions

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Filtering Logic

Added `_should_skip_claim()` method to `generate_batch_folders.py`:

```python
def _should_skip_claim(self, claim: Dict) -> bool:
    """Filter out obvious software patterns."""

    skip_patterns = [
        # Malformed/empty claims
        'none (attributed to: none)',
        'returns (attributed',

        # Software engineering patterns
        'factory', 'registry', 'wrapper',
        'package for', 'module for',

        # Generic implementations
        'statistical analysis package',
        'benchmarking tools',
        'algorithm validation',

        # Code structure
        'enterprise', 'production-ready',

        # Implementation wrappers
        'implements statistical methods',
        'vectorised tuner',
        'high-throughput'
    ]

    # Additional validation:
    # - Check description length
    # - Check word count (< 3 words)
    # - Check for "(attributed to: None)"
```

### 2. Improved ChatGPT Prompt Template

Added **"IMPORTANT - Citation Scope"** section to all prompts:

```markdown
**IMPORTANT - Citation Scope (Read First!):**

✅ **DO provide citations for:**
- Mathematical theorems, lemmas, and proofs
- Control theory algorithms (SMC theory, PSO convergence)
- Statistical methods (Monte Carlo *method*, bootstrap *theory*)
- Numerical analysis techniques (RK45 *algorithm*)
- Physical models and equations

❌ **DO NOT provide citations for:**
- Software design patterns (Factory, Strategy, Observer)
- Module/package/class organization
- Code structure descriptions
- Implementation wrappers
- Return types, parameter validation

**For software patterns, respond:**
"SKIP: Standard software engineering pattern - no citation needed"
```

### 3. Pre-Filtering in Batch Generation

Modified `get_claims_for_batch()` to apply filter BEFORE generating prompts:

```python
# Apply software pattern filter
if not self._should_skip_claim(claim):
    claims_in_batch.append(claim)
```

---
