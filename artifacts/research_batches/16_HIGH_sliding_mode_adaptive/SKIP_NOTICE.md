# ⚠️ BATCH 16 - SKIP NOTICE

**Batch ID:** 16_HIGH_sliding_mode_adaptive
**Status:** **SKIP - No Valid Claims**
**Date Analyzed:** 2025-10-03
**Analysis Method:** Software Pattern Filter v1.0 + Manual Review

---

## Summary

All **11 claims** in this batch are invalid:
- 10 malformed parsing errors
- 1 software architecture description (manual review)

**Result:** Zero valid research claims requiring academic citations.

## Analysis

**Malformed Claims:** 10 / 11 (91%)
**Software Patterns:** 1 / 11 (9%)
**Valid Claims:** 0 / 11 (0%)

**Time Saved:** 2.2 hours (132 minutes)

## Detailed Review: CODE-IMPL-130

**Only claim that passed automatic filter:**

```
Description: "Adaptive Sliding Mode Control using composed components:
- LinearSlidingSurface: Surface computation
- AdaptationLaw: Online gain adjustment
- UncertaintyEstimator: Disturbance bound estimation
- SwitchingFunction: Smooth chattering reduction

Replaces the monolithic 427-line controller with composition of focused modules"
```

**Manual Analysis:**
- **Type:** Software architecture / refactoring documentation
- **Content:** Describes modular composition pattern (software engineering)
- **Citation requirement:** None - this is code organization, not theory
- **Decision:** SKIP

**What WOULD need citation:**
- ✅ "Adaptive law: K̇ = γ|s| - σK" → Cite adaptive control theory
- ✅ "Lyapunov stability proof for adaptation law" → Cite original paper
- ✅ "Chattering reduction via boundary layer method" → Cite Slotine & Li

**What was extracted instead:**
- ❌ "composed components" → Software pattern
- ❌ "Replaces the monolithic 427-line controller" → Refactoring note
- ❌ Component list → Software architecture

## Recommendation

**SKIP** this batch entirely. Move to Batch 17.
