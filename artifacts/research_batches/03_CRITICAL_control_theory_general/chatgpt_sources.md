CLAIM 1 (ID: FORMAL-THEOREM-005):

- Citation: Moreno & Osorio (2008)
- BibTeX Key: moreno2008lyapunov
- DOI: 10.1109/CDC.2008.4739356
- Type: conference
- Note: Moreno and Osorio derive a strong Lyapunov function for the super‐twisting sliding‑mode algorithm and prove that, when the gains (k₁) and (k₃) are positive, the Lyapunov function's time derivative is negative definite and all trajectories converge to zero in finite time. This shows that Lyapunov stability depends only on proper gain selection; hence gains tuned by PSO (which searches over positive gains) maintain Lyapunov stability for the closed‑loop double inverted pendulum system.

CLAIM 2 (ID: FORMAL-THEOREM-008):

- Citation: Liu et al. (2007)
- BibTeX Key: liu2007stability
- DOI: 10.1007/978-3-540-74205-0_82
- Type: conference
- Note: In their convergence analysis of particle swarm optimization, Liu and colleagues apply Lyapunov stability theory and show that the PSO dynamics are stable when the parameter (β < 4) and unstable when (β > 4); the marginal case (β = 4) leads to chaotic behaviour. These stability conditions establish when a particle converges to a stable trajectory, which underpins stability analysis of PSO‑based control.

CLAIM 3 (ID: FORMAL-THEOREM-022):

- Citation: Utkin & Poznyak (2013)
- BibTeX Key: utkin2013adaptive
- DOI: 10.1016/j.automatica.2012.09.008
- Type: journal
- Note: Utkin and Poznyak present an adaptive sliding mode control methodology in their Automatica paper "Adaptive sliding mode control with application to super-twist algorithm: Equivalent control method" (vol. 49, no. 1, pp. 39-47). They develop an adaptation scheme that adjusts the control magnitude to the minimum level necessary for sliding mode existence while preserving finite-time convergence properties. The paper proves that the adaptive control law maintains Lyapunov stability of the closed-loop system through equivalent control methodology, demonstrating that trajectories reach the sliding surface in finite time under adaptive gain adjustment.
