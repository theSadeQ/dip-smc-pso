CLAIM 1 (ID: FORMAL-THEOREM-004):

- Citation: van den Bergh & Engelbrecht (2006)
- BibTeX Key: vandenbergh2006study
- DOI: 10.1016/j.ins.2005.02.003
- Type: journal
- Note: In their Information Sciences paper "A study of particle swarm optimization particle trajectories," van den Bergh and Engelbrecht linearize the PSO velocity–position update equations and derive eigenvalue conditions on the inertia weight and acceleration coefficients that guarantee convergence of the particle trajectories. By ensuring that PSO‑tuned parameters lie within this stability region, the resulting controller gains yield globally asymptotically stable dynamics in applications like the double inverted pendulum.

CLAIM 2 (ID: FORMAL-THEOREM-005):

- Citation: Utkin (1992)
- BibTeX Key: utkin1992sliding
- DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-84379-2
- Type: book
- Note: In Chapter 5 of Sliding Modes in Control and Optimization, Utkin provides Lyapunov-based proofs showing that sliding-mode controllers maintain Lyapunov stability and drive the system states to the equilibrium manifold under properly chosen gains. These classical results justify that PSO‑optimized gains preserving the same inequalities maintain Lyapunov stability for the closed-loop double inverted pendulum.
