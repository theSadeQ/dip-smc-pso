## ChatGPT Response (Corrected Version)

CLAIM 1 (ID: FORMAL-THEOREM-001):

* Citation: Hespanha et al. (2003)
* BibTeX Key: hespanha2003hysteresis
* DOI: 10.1016/S0005-1098(02)00241-8
* Type: journal
* Note: Automatica – The authors introduce hysteresis-based switching for supervisory control and prove that when monitoring signals have bounded derivatives, a hysteresis deadband prevents chattering: the switching signal changes only after the continuous trajectory traverses the overlap region, so only finitely many switches can occur on any finite time interval.

* Citation: Morse, Mayne & Goodwin (1992)
* BibTeX Key: morse1992applications
* DOI: 10.1109/9.151225
* Type: journal
* Note: IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control – This paper applies hysteresis switching in parameter-adaptive control; by introducing separate up/down thresholds (a deadband), the authors show that the switching law enforces a positive dwell time and thus prevents rapid oscillatory switching among controllers.

* Citation: Weller & Goodwin (1994)
* BibTeX Key: weller1994hysteresis
* DOI: 10.1109/9.299622
* Type: journal
* Note: IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control – In their model‑reference adaptive control scheme, Weller & Goodwin employ Morse's hysteresis switching strategy and highlight that "hysteresis in the switching algorithm precludes switching arbitrarily rapidly between estimators, and all switching ceases within a finite time". This directly supports the claim that a hysteresis deadband (with δ) prevents chattering by ensuring a finite number of switchings.

## Correction History

**Original Citation 3 (REJECTED):**
- Miljković (2021)
- DOI: 10.23919/MIPRO52101.2021.9596786
- Reason for Rejection: ChatGPT hallucinated - actual paper is about cymatics/aircraft engine noise visualization, NOT about hysteresis switching or fault detection

**Replacement Citation 3 (ACCEPTED):**
- Weller & Goodwin (1994)
- DOI: 10.1109/9.299622
- Quality: Tier 1 (IEEE TAC), foundational work, perfect topical match

**Notes:**
- First batch requiring citation correction
- ChatGPT's replacement citation (Weller 1994) was excellent
- All citations form a coherent progression: Morse (1992) → Weller (1994) → Hespanha (2003)
- These are foundational papers for hysteresis switching in adaptive and supervisory control
