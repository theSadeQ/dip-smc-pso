(2013),shtessel2013sliding,10.1007/978-0-8176-4893-0_1,book,"Chapter 1 of Shtessel’s textbook introduces the sliding variable (σ=x_2+c,x_1) with (c>0). The authors derive the desired dynamics ( \dot{x}_1 + c x_1 =0) and solve it to get (x_1(t)=x_1(0)e^{-ct}) and (x_2(t)=-c,x_1(0)e^{-ct}), noting that both states converge exponentially at a rate (c). They explain that driving (σ) to zero in finite time produces these exponential dynamics with convergence rates determined by the positive parameter (c).",docs/theory/smc_theory_complete.md,71,,,0.9

Integrating this inequality shows that the trajectory reaches the sliding surface in finite time bounded by (t_{\mathrm{reach}} \le |s(0)|/\eta). This provides a formal bound on the time required to reach the sliding surface under the reaching condition.",docs/theory/smc_theory_complete.md,132,,,0.9

(2013),shtessel2013sliding,10.1007/978-0-8176-4893-0_1,book,"Same source as Claim 1. In the same chapter, Shtessel and co‑authors propose a sliding‑mode control law (u=-c,x_2-\varphi,\mathrm{sign}(σ)) and show that the control gain (\varphi) must exceed the disturbance bound (L) by choosing (\varphi = L + \alpha\sqrt{2}). They remark that the first term (L) compensates for the bounded uncertainty while the additional term (\alpha\sqrt{2}) determines the reaching time; a larger (\alpha) yields a shorter finite‑time convergence to the sliding surface. This classical result demonstrates that choosing the switching gain greater than the uncertainty bound guarantees finite‑time convergence.",docs/theory/smc_theory_complete.md,160,,,0.9

To mitigate chattering, Slotine and Li introduce a boundary layer of thickness (\phi) around the sliding surface and replace the discontinuous sign function with (s/\phi) within this layer. They prove that this boundary‑layer method makes the layer attractive and ensures that the tracking error components satisfy (|x_i(t)| \le 2\lambda,\varepsilon) for (i=0,\dots,n-1), where (\varepsilon) is proportional to (\phi). Thus, the tracking error is ultimately bounded by a constant determined by the boundary‑layer width, providing a practical bound on the steady‑state error.",docs/theory/smc_theory_complete.md,322,,,0.9
