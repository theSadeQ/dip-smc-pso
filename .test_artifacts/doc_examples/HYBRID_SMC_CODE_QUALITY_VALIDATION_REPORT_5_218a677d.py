"""
Modular Hybrid SMC Controller.

Implements Hybrid Sliding Mode Control that intelligently switches between
multiple SMC algorithms based on system conditions and performance metrics.

Orchestrates:
- Multiple SMC controllers (Classical, Adaptive, Super-Twisting)
- Intelligent switching logic
- Smooth control transitions
- Performance monitoring and learning
