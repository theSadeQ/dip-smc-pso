# BEFORE FIX - Broken Implementation
def compute_control(self, state, state_vars, history):
    # ... 674 lines of complex control algorithm implementation ...

    # Comments about packaging outputs:
    # Package the outputs into a structured named tuple. Returning a
    # named tuple formalises the contract and allows clients to
    # access fields by name while retaining tuple compatibility.

    # ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: Missing return statement!
    # Function implicitly returns None

def reset(self) -> None:
    """Reset controller state."""
    # ... reset logic ...

    # ❌ WRONG LOCATION: Return statement with out-of-scope variables
    return HybridSTAOutput(u_sat, (k1_new, k2_new, u_int_new), history, float(s))
    # Variables u_sat, k1_new, k2_new, etc. are not in scope here!
