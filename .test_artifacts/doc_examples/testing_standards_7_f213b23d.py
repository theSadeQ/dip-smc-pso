def test_sliding_surface_convergence():
    """Test that states converge to sliding surface under classical SMC.

    Theory:
    -------
    Classical SMC guarantees finite-time convergence to sliding surface
    s(x) = 0 when switching gain K > uncertainty bound.

    Reference: Utkin, V. "Sliding Modes in Control and Optimization"

    Test Setup:
    ----------
    - Initial state away from equilibrium
    - Classical SMC with sufficient switching gain
    - Simulation until convergence or timeout

    Verification:
    ------------
    - |s(x(t))| â†’ 0 as t increases
    - Convergence time < theoretical bound
    - No chattering beyond boundary layer
