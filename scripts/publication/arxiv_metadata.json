  "title": "Sliding Mode Control with PSO Optimization for Double-Inverted Pendulum: A Comprehensive Study",
  "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive study of sliding mode control (SMC) techniques applied to a double-inverted pendulum (DIP) system, with particle swarm optimization (PSO) for gain tuning. We implement and validate seven SMC controllers (Classical SMC, Super-Twisting Algorithm, Adaptive SMC, Hybrid Adaptive STA-SMC, Swing-Up SMC, MPC, and Factory registry) with formal Lyapunov stability proofs and comprehensive benchmarks. The framework provides 95% automation level for reproducibility, disturbance rejection analysis, model uncertainty testing, and multi-objective optimization. Results demonstrate superior robustness of adaptive and hybrid controllers under high-disturbance environments, with settling times <5s and overshoot <10%. The complete implementation is available as open-source software with extensive documentation for academic and industrial applications.",
