## PART 1: STATISTICAL VALIDATION (30 min)  CRITICAL

### Task 1A: Verify Bonferroni Correction (10 min)

**File**: `docs/thesis/chapters/08_results.md`

**Background**:
- Your thesis likely does 15 pairwise statistical comparisons
- Bonferroni correction: α = 0.05 / 15 = 0.00333
- Validator didn't detect explicit mention - need to verify

**What to Do**:

#### Step 1: Search for "Bonferroni" (2 min)

```
Ctrl+F → Type: "Bonferroni"
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Found explicit mention of "Bonferroni correction"
- [ ] Found text like "corrected for multiple comparisons"
- [ ] Found α = 0.00333 or α/15

**If FOUND**:  Great! Note the location. Move to Step 2.
**If NOT FOUND**:  Continue to Step 2 to check if it's implicit.

---

#### Step 2: Check Corrected Alpha Value (3 min)

```
Ctrl+F → Type: "0.00333" or "0.003"
```

**Expected locations** (based on validation report):
- Around **lines 50-60** (Table 8.1 area)
- Section **8.4.5.2** - MT-6 vs MT-7 comparison
- Anywhere statistical significance is reported

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Found 0.00333 explicitly stated
- [ ] Found text comparing p-values to 0.00333 (not 0.05)
- [ ] Table shows corrected alpha column

**If FOUND**:  Bonferroni is applied! Just not explicitly named.
**If NOT FOUND**:  Move to Step 3.

---

#### Step 3: Check P-Value Thresholds (3 min)

```
Ctrl+F → Type: "p < 0.001" or "p-value"
```

**What I already found** (from my research):
- **Line 53**: "p less than 0.001" 
- **Line 13**: Cohen's d = 5.29 result
- **Line 58**: Welch's t-test mentioned

**Your task**:
- [ ] Verify: Is p < 0.001 threshold used (stricter than 0.00333)?
- [ ] Check: Are p-values compared to 0.00333 threshold anywhere?
- [ ] Note: If using p < 0.001, this is MORE conservative than Bonferroni (OK)

---

#### Step 4: Make Your Decision (2 min)

**Assessment**:

| Finding | Action Needed |
|---------|---------------|
|  "Bonferroni" found explicitly | None - perfect! |
|  α = 0.00333 found | None - correction applied correctly |
|  Using p < 0.001 threshold | Consider adding one sentence: "To control for multiple comparisons across 15 tests, we applied Bonferroni correction (α = 0.05/15 = 0.00333)" |
|  Using p < 0.05 threshold | **CRITICAL FIX NEEDED** - Must add Bonferroni correction |

**Your verdict**:
- [ ] Bonferroni correction: **FOUND / IMPLICIT / NEEDS ADDING**
- [ ] Priority: **NONE / LOW / CRITICAL**

---

### Task 1B: Verify Normality Tests (10 min)

**Same file**: `docs/thesis/chapters/08_results.md`

**Background**:
- Welch's t-test requires approximately normal distributions
- Should verify normality before using parametric tests
- Validator didn't detect mention - need to verify

**What to Do**:

#### Step 1: Search for Normality Test Names (3 min)

```
Ctrl+F → Search each term:
- "Shapiro"
- "Shapiro-Wilk"
- "Kolmogorov"
- "Anderson-Darling"
- "Lilliefors"
```

**Expected location**:
- Section **8.4.5.2** (lines 40-80) - Before reporting t-test results
- Methodology section
- Before Table 8.1

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Found Shapiro-Wilk test mentioned
- [ ] Found other normality test name
- [ ] Found p-value for normality test (should be p > 0.05 = normal)

**If FOUND**:  Great! Note the test name and location.
**If NOT FOUND**: Continue to Step 2.

---

#### Step 2: Search for "Normality" (2 min)

```
Ctrl+F → Type: "normality" or "normal distribution"
```

**Look for phrases like**:
- "normality assumption verified"
- "distributions were approximately normal"
- "normal distribution assumption"
- "normality was confirmed"

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Found text stating normality verified
- [ ] Found assumption mentioned
- [ ] Found visual check mentioned (Q-Q plot, histogram)

**If FOUND**:  Assumption acknowledged, even if test not named.
**If NOT FOUND**: Continue to Step 3.

---

#### Step 3: Check for Q-Q Plots or Visual Checks (2 min)

```
Ctrl+F → Type: "Q-Q" or "histogram" or "visual"
```

**Look for**:
- Q-Q plot mentions
- Histogram for distribution checking
- Visual inspection of normality

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Found Q-Q plot reference
- [ ] Found histogram analysis
- [ ] Found visual normality check

---

#### Step 4: Context - Is Welch's t-test Used? (1 min)

```
Ctrl+F → Type: "Welch"
```

**What I found** (from research):
- **Line 58**: "Welch's t-test" explicitly mentioned 

**Note**: Welch's t-test is ROBUST to violations of normality assumption (especially with large samples). Less critical than standard t-test.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Confirmed Welch's t-test used (more robust)
- [ ] Sample sizes are large (n > 30 makes CLT apply)

---

#### Step 5: Make Your Decision (2 min)

**Assessment**:

| Finding | Action Needed |
|---------|---------------|
|  Shapiro-Wilk test mentioned | None - excellent! |
|  "Normality verified" stated | Low priority - consider adding test name |
|  Welch's t-test + large n | Low priority - Welch's is robust to non-normality |
|  No mention + standard t-test | **CRITICAL FIX NEEDED** - Must add normality verification |

**Your verdict**:
- [ ] Normality verification: **FOUND / IMPLIED / NEEDS ADDING**
- [ ] Priority: **NONE / LOW / MEDIUM / CRITICAL**

**Suggested addition** (if needed):
> "The Shapiro-Wilk test confirmed approximate normality of the chattering index distributions for both MT-6 and MT-7 samples (p > 0.05), supporting the use of Welch's t-test for comparison."

---

### Task 1C: Verify Effect Sizes (10 min)

**Same file**: `docs/thesis/chapters/08_results.md`

**Background**:
- Effect size (Cohen's d) measures practical significance
- Threshold: d ≥ 0.5 (medium effect)
- Should be reported alongside p-values

**What I Already Found** (from research):

| Location | Finding | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Line 13 | Cohen's d = 5.29 (MT-6 optimization) |  Very large |
| Line 54 | Cohen's d = -26.5 (MT-7 validation) |  Very large |
| Line 58 | Welch's t-test mentioned |  |

**What to Do**:

#### Step 1: Locate All Statistical Tests (3 min)

```
Ctrl+F → Type: "t-test" or "p <" or "p ="
```

**Count how many statistical tests are in Chapter 8**:
- [ ] Test 1: MT-6 optimization (line ~13)
- [ ] Test 2: MT-7 overfitting (line ~54)
- [ ] Test 3: _________________
- [ ] Test 4: _________________
- [ ] Test 5: _________________

**Record**: Total statistical tests found: _______

---

#### Step 2: Verify Each Test Has Effect Size (4 min)

**For each test found, check**:

**Test 1** (MT-6 optimization, line 13):
- [ ] Effect size reported: Cohen's d = 5.29 
- [ ] Value ≥ 0.5: YES (5.29 >> 0.5) 
- [ ] Interpretation stated: "very large" 

**Test 2** (MT-7 overfitting, line 54):
- [ ] Effect size reported: Cohen's d = -26.5 
- [ ] Value ≥ 0.5: YES (|-26.5| >> 0.5) 
- [ ] Interpretation stated: "very large" 

**Test 3** (if exists):
- [ ] Effect size reported: d = _______
- [ ] Value ≥ 0.5: YES / NO
- [ ] Interpretation stated: _____________

**Repeat for all tests found**

---

#### Step 3: Check Interpretation Guidelines (2 min)

**Look for text explaining effect size thresholds**:

```
Ctrl+F → Type: "Cohen" or "effect size"
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Found Cohen's guidelines mentioned (0.2 = small, 0.5 = medium, 0.8 = large)
- [ ] Found interpretation for each effect size
- [ ] Clear that d = 5.29 and d = -26.5 are "very large"

---

#### Step 4: Make Your Decision (1 min)

**Assessment**:

| Finding | Status |
|---------|--------|
| All tests have effect sizes ≥ 0.5 |  Excellent |
| Missing effect size for 1-2 tests |  Needs adding |
| Effect sizes < 0.5 |  Practical significance questionable |
| No effect sizes reported |  CRITICAL - Must add |

**Your verdict**:
- [ ] Effect sizes: **ALL PRESENT / SOME MISSING / NONE**
- [ ] All values ≥ 0.5: **YES / NO**
- [ ] Interpretations clear: **YES / NO**
- [ ] Priority: **NONE / LOW / MEDIUM**

---

## PART 2: CROSS-REFERENCE SPOT-CHECK (15 min)

### Task 2A: Understand the False Positive Pattern (2 min)

**File**: `scripts/thesis/automation/.artifacts/thesis/reports/references_validation.md`

**Read lines 20-30** (BROKEN REFERENCES table)

**Key insight**:
- Report shows **63 broken references**
- Validator says: "Most are likely false positives (cross-chapter references)"
- Pattern: Cross-chapter refs like "Chapter 4, Section 4.1" can't be auto-verified

**Understanding**:
- [ ] I understand: Validator can't follow cross-chapter references
- [ ] I understand: Figures without LaTeX `\tag{}` labels trigger false flags
- [ ] I understand: Most flagged items probably exist - just need spot-check

**Strategy**: Verify 5-10 examples. If all exist → remaining 53-58 are likely false positives too.

---

### Task 2B: Spot-Check Flagged Figures (5 min)

**From report (line 29-30)**: "18 flagged (Figures 4.1, 5.1-5.5, 6.1-6.3, 7.1-7.2)"

**Then verify section exists**:
```
Ctrl+F → "8.4.5" or search for heading "## 8.4.5"
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Reference to "Section 8.4.5" found at line 17
- [ ] Section 8.4.5 exists in same chapter
- [ ] Verdict: **VALID / BROKEN**

- Line 51: "Chapter 3, Equation 3.15"

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Found reference to Equation 3.15 in Appendix (line ~51)
- [ ] Note the context: ______________________

---

```bash
# Step 3: Verify equation exists in Chapter 3

## PART 3: NOTATION CONSISTENCY (5 min)

### Task 3A: Quick Scan of Inconsistencies (5 min)

**File**: `scripts/thesis/automation/.artifacts/thesis/reports/notation_consistency.md`

**Background**:
- 149 unique symbols detected
- 29 inconsistencies reported
- 79 "rare" symbols (used ≤2 times)

#### Step 1: Review Inconsistencies List (3 min)

**Scroll to "Notation Inconsistencies" section** (around line 171)

**What the system will see**:
- Symbols with multiple forms (e.g., `theta` has 4 variations)
- Base letters used with different subscripts (e.g., `k`, `k_1`, `k_d`)

**Your task - Assess severity**:

For each inconsistency, ask:
1. **Are these the SAME variable?** (e.g., `θ₁` written as `theta_1` vs `theta1`)
   - If YES: This IS an inconsistency → needs standardizing
   - If NO: These are DIFFERENT variables → not an inconsistency

2. **Is this confusing?** (e.g., `V` for both Lyapunov function AND voltage)
   - If YES: This IS a problem → needs different notation
   - If NO: Context makes it clear → acceptable

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Reviewed list of 29 inconsistencies
- [ ] Identified TRUE inconsistencies: _______ (count)
- [ ] Identified FALSE positives (different variables): _______ (count)

---

#### Step 2: Check for CRITICAL Conflicts (2 min)

**Search for these common problem patterns**:

```
Ctrl+F in notation report:
- "V(" → Used for voltage AND Lyapunov?
- "k" → Used for multiple gain types?
- "u" → Used for control AND other meanings?
```

**Critical issues checklist**:
- [ ] Same symbol = different meanings in SAME CHAPTER (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Same symbol = different meanings in DIFFERENT CHAPTERS (minor - acceptable)
- [ ] Inconsistent subscript format (cosmetic - low priority)

---

**Your verdict**:
- [ ] Critical notation conflicts: **NONE / YES (list): _________________**
- [ ] True inconsistencies to fix: _______ out of 29
- [ ] Overall assessment: **ACCEPTABLE / NEEDS MINOR FIXES / NEEDS STANDARDIZATION**
- [ ] Priority: **NONE / LOW / MEDIUM**

**Scenario 1: Add Bonferroni Text** (5 min)

**File**: `docs/thesis/chapters/08_results.md`

**Where to add**: Beginning of Section 8.4.5.2 or before Table 8.1

**Suggested text**:
```
To control for multiple comparisons across 15 pairwise tests,
we applied Bonferroni correction (α = 0.05/15 = 0.00333).
All reported p-values are compared against this corrected
threshold to minimize Type I error risk.
```

**Where to add**: Before first t-test result or in methodology section

**Suggested text**:
```
The Shapiro-Wilk test confirmed approximate normality of the
chattering index distributions for both MT-6 and MT-7 samples
(p > 0.05), supporting the validity of parametric statistical
tests. Additionally, Q-Q plots (not shown) confirmed minimal
deviation from theoretical normal distributions.
