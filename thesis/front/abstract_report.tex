This report presents the design, implementation, and performance analysis of sliding mode control (SMC) for double-inverted pendulum (DIP) stabilization---a canonical benchmark for underactuated nonlinear systems. Four SMC variants are developed and compared: classical SMC with boundary layer, super-twisting algorithm (STA-SMC) for chattering reduction, adaptive SMC with online gain tuning, and hybrid adaptive STA-SMC combining both techniques. Controller gains are systematically optimized using particle swarm optimization (PSO) with a multi-objective cost function balancing settling time, overshoot, energy consumption, and chattering amplitude.

Comprehensive Monte Carlo benchmarks ($N=100$ trials per controller) demonstrate that PSO-optimized hybrid adaptive STA-SMC achieves: (1) 40\% faster settling time (1.85~s vs.\ 3.15~s baseline), (2) 70\% reduced chattering amplitude (159~N vs.\ 623~N total variation), (3) 2.3\% peak overshoot, and (4) robust performance under $\pm$30\% simultaneous parameter variations with only 12\% settling time degradation. Statistical analysis confirms performance improvements with 95\% confidence intervals. All controllers are validated through high-fidelity simulation using fourth-order Runge-Kutta integration. Complete implementation is provided as open-source software for reproducibility.
