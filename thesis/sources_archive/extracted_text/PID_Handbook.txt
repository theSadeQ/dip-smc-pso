Preface
Proportional Integral (PI) and Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers have been at the heart of control engineering practice for seven decades. However, in spite of this, the PID controller has not received much attention from the academic research community until the past fifteen years, when work by K.J. Astrom, T. Hagglund and F.G. Shinskey, among others, has sparked a revival of interest in the use of this "workhorse" of controller implementation.
There is strong evidence that PI and PID controllers remain poorly understood and, in particular, poorly tuned in many applications. It is clear that the many controller tuning rules proposed in the literature are not having an impact on industrial practice. One reason is that the tuning rules are not very accessible, being scattered throughout the control literature; in addition, the notation used is not unified. The purpose of this book is to bring together and summarise, using a unified notation, tuning rules for PI and PID controllers. The author restricts the work to tuning rules that may be applied to the control of processes with time delays (dead times); in practice, this is not a significant restriction, as most process models have a time delay term.
It is the author's belief that this book will be useful to control and instrument engineering practitioners and will be a useful reference for students and educators in universities and technical colleges.
I would like to thank the School of Control Systems and Electrical Engineering, Dublin Institute of Technology, for providing the facilities needed to complete the book. Finally, I am deeply grateful to my mother, Lillian and my father, Sean, for their inspiration and support over many

Introduction
1.1 Preliminary Remarks
The ability of proportional integral (PI) and proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers to compensate most practical industrial processes has led to their wide acceptance in industrial applications. Koivo and Tanttu (1991), for example, suggest that there are perhaps 510% of control loops that cannot be controlled by single input, single output (SISO) PI or PID controllers; in particular, these controllers perform well for processes with benign dynamics and modest performance requirements (Hwang, 1993; Astrom and Hagglund, 1995). It has been stated that 98% of control loops in the pulp and paper industries are controlled by SISO PI controllers (Bialkowski, 1996) and that, in process control applications, more than 95% of the controllers are of PID type (Astrom and Hagglund, 1995). The PI or PID controller implementation has been recommended for the control of processes of low to medium order, with small time delays, when parameter setting must be done using tuning rules and when controller synthesis is performed either once or more often (Isermann, 1989).
However, despite decades of development work, surveys indicating the state of the art of control industrial practice report sobering results. For example, Ender (1993) states that, in his testing of thousands of control loops in hundreds of plants, it has been found that more than 30% of installed controllers are operating in manual mode and 65% of loops operating in automatic mode produce less variance in manual than in automatic (i.e. the automatic controllers are poorly tuned). The situation
l

does not appear to have improved in recent years as Van Overschee and De Moor (2000) report that 80% of PID controllers are badly tuned; 30% of PID controllers operate in manual with another 30% of the controlled loops increasing the short term variability of the process to be controlled (typically due to too strong integral action). The authors state that 25% of all PID controller loops use default factory settings, implying that they have not been tuned at all.
These and other surveys (well summarised by Yu, 1999, pages 1-2) show that the determination of PI and PID controller tuning parameters is a vexing problem in many applications. The most direct way to set up controller parameters is the use of tuning rules; obviously, the wealth of information on this topic available in the literature has been poorly communicated to the industrial community. One reason is that this information is scattered in a variety of media, including journal papers, conference papers, websites and books over a period of seventy years. The author has recorded 408 separate sources of tuning rules since the first such rule was published by Callender et al. (1935/6). In a striking statistic, 293 sources of tuning rules have been recorded since 1992, reflecting the upsurge of interest in the use of the PID controller recently.
The purpose of this book is to bring together, in summary form, the tuning rules for PI and PID controllers that have been developed to compensate SISO processes with time delay. Tuning rules for the variations that have been proposed in the 'ideal' PI and PID controller structure are included. Considerable variations in the ideal PID controller structure, in particular, are encountered; these variations are explored in more detail in Chapter 2.

1.2 Structure of the Book
Tuning rules are set out in the book in tabular form. This form allows the rules to be represented compactly. The tables have four or five columns, according to whether the controller considered is of PI or PID form, respectively. The first column in all cases details the author of the rule and other pertinent information. The final column in all cases is labelled "Comment"; this facilitates the inclusion of information about the tuning

rule that may be useful in its application. The remaining columns detail the formulae for the controller parameters.
Chapter 2 explores the range of PI and PID controller structures proposed in the literature. It is often forgotton that different manufacturers implement different versions of the PID controller algorithm (in particular); therefore, controller tuning rules that work well in one PID architecture may work poorly on another. This chapter also details the process models used to define the controller tuning rules.
Chapters 3 and 4 of the book detail, in tabular form, tuning rules for setting up, respectively, PI controllers and PID controllers (and their variations), for a wide variety of process models. P controller and I controller tuning rules are also defined (as subsets of PI controller tuning rules), and PD controller tuning rules are defined (as a subset of PID controller tuning rules), for processes whose model includes an integrator. One hundred and eighty-three such tables are provided altogether. To allow the reader to access data readily, the author has arranged that each table start on its own page of the book; each table is preceded by the controller used, together with a block diagram showing the unity feedback closed loop arrangement of the controller and process model.
In Chapter 5 of the book, analytical calculations of the gain and phase margins of a large sample of PI and PID controller tuning rules are determined, when the process is modelled in first order lag plus time delay (FOLPD) form, at a range of ratios of time delay to time constant of the process model. Results are given in graphical form.
An important feature of the book is the unified notation that is used for the tuning rules; a glossary of the symbols used is provided in Appendix 1. Appendix 2 outlines the range of methods that are used to determine process model parameters; this information is presented in summary form, as this topic could provide data for a book in itself. However, sufficient information, together with references, is provided for the interested reader.
Finally, a comprehensive reference list is provided. In particular, the author would like to recommend the contributions by McMillan (1994), Astrom and Hagglund (1995), Shinskey (1994), (1996), Tan et al. (1999a), Yu (1999), Lelic and Gajic (2000) and Ang et al. (2005) to the

2.1 Introduction

The ideal continuous time domain PID controller for a SISO process is expressed in the Laplace domain as follows:

U(s) = Gc(s)E(s)

(2.1)

with

Gc(s) = Kc(l + -^- + Tds)

(2.2)

and with Kc = proportional gain, Tj = integral time constant and Td = derivative time constant. If T; = oo and Td - 0 (i.e. P control), then it is clear that the closed loop measured value, y, will always be less than the desired value, r (for processes without an integrator term, as a positive error is necessary to keep the measured value constant, and less than the desired value). The introduction of integral action facilitates the achievement of equality between the measured value and the desired value, as a constant error produces an increasing controller output. The introduction of derivative action means that changes in the desired value may be anticipated, and thus an appropriate correction may be added prior to the actual change. Thus, in simplified terms, the PID controller allows contributions from present controller inputs, past controller inputs and future controller inputs.
Many variations of the PI and, in particular, the PID controller structure have been proposed. As Tan et al. (1999a) suggest, one

important reason for the non-standard structures is due to the transition of the controllers from pneumatic implementation through electronic implementation to the present microprocessor implementation. The variations in the controller structures are detailed below.

2.2 PI Controller Structures

Tuning rules have been detailed for seven PI controller structures:

1. Ideal controller Gc(s) = K( i + - L

'generalised PID' controller (Lee and Shi, 2002)):

2.3 PID Controller Structures

Forty-six such structures have been considered. The labelling of these structures has not been consistent in the literature; for example, the first PID controller structure considered (labelled the ideal controller below) has also been labelled the 'non-interacting' controller (McMillan, 1994), the 'ISA' algorithm (Gerry and Hansen, 1987) or the 'parallel noninteracting' controller (Visioli, 2001). The controller structures have been divided into four types, as described below.

A variation of the controller is labelled the 'parallel' controller

structure (McMillan, 1994). This variation has also been labelled the

'ideal parallel', 'noninteracting', 'independent' or 'gain independent'

algorithm:

2.3.5 Comments on the PID controller structures

In some cases, one controller structure may be transformed into another; clearly, the ideal and parallel controller structures (equations (2.10) and (2.11)) are very closely related. It is shown by McMillan (1994), among others, that the parameters of the ideal PID controller may be worked out from the parameters of the series PID controller, and vice versa. The ideal PID controller is given in Equation (2.58) and the series PID controller is given in Equation (2.59).

Astrom and Hagglund (1996) point out that the ideal controller admits complex zeroes and is thus a more flexible controller structure than the series controller, which has real zeroes; however, in the frequency domain, the series controller has the interesting interpretation that the zeroes of the closed loop transfer function are the inverse values of Tis and Tds. O'Dwyer (2001b) developed a comprehensive set of tuning rules for the series PID controller, based on the ideal PID controller; as these are not strictly original tuning rules, only representative examples are included in the relevant tables.
In a similar manner, the parameters of an ideal controller in series with a first order filter may be determined from the parameters of the classical controller 1 (Witt and Waggoner, 1990) and the parameters of

20

Handbook of PI and PID Controller Tuning Rules

the non-interacting controller 10 structure may be determined from the parameters of the ideal PID controller (Kaya et al, 2003).

2.4 Process Modelling

Processes with time delay may be modelled in a variety of ways. The

modelling strategy used will influence the value of the model parameters,

which will in turn affect the controller values determined from the tuning

rules. The modelling strategy used in association with each tuning rule,

as described in the original papers, is indicated in the tables (see

Chapters 3 and 4). These modelling strategies are outlined in Appendix

2. The following models are defined:

K e~STm

1. First order lag plus time delay (FOLPD) model ( G m (s) = --

)

Table 1 shows that 82% of tuning rules have been defined for the ideal PI controller structure, with 42% of tuning rules based on a FOLPD process model.
The range of PID controller variations has lead to a less homogenous situation than for the PI controller; Table 2 shows that 40% of tuning rules have been defined for the ideal PID controller structure, with 37% of tuning rules based on a FOLPD process model. Many of the controller structures are used in a variety of manufacturers' products (as outlined in Section 2.3); clearly a range of tuning rules are available for use with these products.

2.5 Organisation of the Tuning Rules
The tuning rules are organised in tabular form in Chapters 3 and 4. Within each table, the tuning rules are classified further; the main subdivisions made are as follows: (i) Tuning rules based on a measured step response (also called process
reaction curve methods), (ii) Tuning rules based on minimising an appropriate performance
criterion, either for optimum regulator or optimum servo action, (iii) Tuning rules that give a specified closed loop response (direct
synthesis tuning rules). Such rules may be defined by specifying the

Chapter 2: Controller Architecture

25

desired poles of the closed loop response, for instance, though more generally, the desired closed loop transfer function may be specified. The definition may be expanded to cover techniques that allow the achievement of a specified gain margin and/or phase margin, (iv) Robust tuning rules, with an explicit robust stability and robust performance criterion built in to the design process, (v) Tuning rules based on recording appropriate parameters at the ultimate frequency (also called ultimate cycling methods), (vi) Other tuning rules, such as tuning rules that depend on the proportional gain required to achieve a quarter decay ratio or to achieve magnitude and frequency information at a particular phase lag. Some tuning rules could be considered to belong to more than one subdivision, so the subdivisions cannot be considered to be mutually exclusive; nevertheless, they provide a convenient way to classify the rules. In the tables, all symbols used are defined in Appendix 1.

Performance and Robustness Issues in the Compensation of FOLPD Processes with PI
and PID Controllers
5.1 Introduction
This chapter will discuss the compensation of FOLPD processes using PI and PID controllers whose parameters are specified using appropriate tuning rules. The gain margin, phase margin and maximum sensitivity of the compensated system as the ratio of time delay to time constant of the process varies, are used as ways of judging the performance and robustness of the system. This work follows the method of Ho et al. (1995b), (1996), in which good approximations for the gain and phase margins of the PI or PID controlled system are analytically calculated. The method will be extended to determine analytically the maximum sensitivity of the compensated system. Insight will be obtained into the range of time delay to time constant ratios over which it is sensible to apply various tuning rules, to compensate a FOLPD process.
The chapter is organised as follows. Formulae for calculating analytically the gain margin, phase margin and maximum sensitivity are outlined in Sections 5.2 and 5.3. The performance and robustness of FOLPD processes compensated with a variety of PI and PID tuning rules are evaluated in Section 5.4. In Section 5.5, tuning rules are designed to achieve constant gain and phase margins for all values of delay, for a number of process models and controller structures. Conclusions of the

work are drawn in Section 5.6. This work was previously published by O'Dwyer (1998), (2001a).

5.2 The Analytical Determination of Gain and Phase Margin

5.2.1 PI tuning formulae

The controller and process model are respectively given by

Gc(s) = Kc K Tis;

(5.1)

K_e~ Gm(s) = 1 + sT

(5.2)

Then

(rjm(jccuo*)Gc c(jrcwo>) = KmG~>aZm K c ( J » T i + l ) l + j©Tm jooT;

(5.3)

From the definition of gain and phase margin, the following sets of

equations are obtained:

<t>m =arg|Gc(j©g)Gm(ja)g)j+7i

(5.4)

1 Am = |Gc(jcop)Gm(jcop)

(5.5)

where co and co are given by

|Gc(jcog)Gm(jcog)| = l

(5.6)

arg[Gc(ja> )Gm(ja> ) J = - T I

(5.7)

From Equation (5.3),

G m ( j c o ) G c ( ] c Ko )m-K^c^J l

+ G>2Ti2 !-

coTj -y/l + c2o2^Tn2

Z - 0.57T + tan-1 coTj - tan-1 ©Tm - coxm (5.8)

Therefore, from Equation (5.4)

(|>m = 7t-0.5n + tan~1cogTi -tan_1cogTm -cogTm

(5.9)

with co given by the solution of Equation (5.6) i.e.

(5.25) As with Equation (5.12), an analytical solution of this equation is not possible. An approximate analytical solution may be obtained if the approximation detailed in Equation (5.14) is made. Looking at Equation (5.25), twelve possibilities present themselves if the approximation in Equation (5.14) is to be used; these possibilities are

(1) copT; > 1, ffiT > 1 (a) copTd < 1, ©paTd < 1 (b)copTd > 1 , copaTd < 1 (c) o p T d > 1. ^paTd > 1

The gain and phase margin of the compensated system, for each of the tuning rules, as a function of tm/Tm may now be calculated by applying Equations (5.20), (5.21), (5.24) and the relevant approximation for oop from Equations (5.26) to (5.37). As Equation (5.19) shows, the procedure applies to tuning rules defined for the classical PID controller structure only; however, Ho et al. (1996) suggest that the method may be applied to tuning rules defined for the ideal PID controller structure, by using equations that approximately convert these tuning rules into their equivalent in the classical controller structure.

5.3 The Analytical Determination of Maximum Sensitivity

The maximum sensitivity is the reciprocal of the shortest distance from

the Nyquist curve to the (-1,0) point on the Rl-Im axis. It is defined as

follows:

1
Mmax = Max
all ra l + Gm(jco)Gc(jco)

(5.38)

For a FOLPD process model controlled by a PI controller,

Vl + oo'Tj2 |Gm(jco)Gc(jco)| =

KcKr

(5.39)

470

Handbook of PI and PID Controller Tuning Rules

and arg[Gm (j©)Gc (jco)] = -0.5TT - tan"1 coTm + tan"1 oaT; - coxm
For a FOLPD process model controlled by a PID controller,

(5.40)

V(l + co2Tm2)(l + a V T d 2 ) »T>
and arg[Gm(jco)Gc(jco)] = - 0.5TC - tan"1 coTm - tan"1 coaTd + tan-1 coT; + tan"1 coTd - coxm (5.42)
The maximum sensitivity may be calculated over an appropriate range of frequencies corresponding to phase lags of 100° to 260°.

5.4 Simulation Results
Space considerations dictate that only representative simulation results may be provided; an extensive set of simulation results covering 103 PI controller tuning rules and 125 PID controller tuning rules (for the ideal and classical controller structures) are available (O'Dwyer, 2000). The MATLAB package has been used in the simulations. Figures 2 to 7 show how gain margin, phase margin and maximum sensitivity vary as the ratio of time delay to time constant varies, if some PI tuning rules are used (Figures 2 to 4) and corresponding PID tuning rules for the classical controller structure (with a = 0.1) are used (Figures 5 to 7). In these results, Z-N refers to the process reaction curve method of Ziegler and Nichols (1942); W-W refers to the process reaction curve method of Witt and Waggoner (1990); IAE reg, ISE reg and ITAE reg refer to the tuning rules for regulator applications that minimise the integral of absolute error criterion, the integral of squared error criterion and the integral of time multiplied by absolute error criterion, respectively, as defined by Murrill (1967) for PI tuning rules and Kaya and Scheib (1988) for PID tuning rules based on the classical controller structure. Figures 8 to 15 show gain and phase margin comparisons between corresponding PI and PID controller tuning rules.
It is clear that the gain margin is generally less when the PID rather than the PI tuning rules are considered, over the ratios of time delay to

Chapter 5: Performance and Robustness Issues...

471

time constant taken; the difference between the phase margins is less clear cut. This suggests that these PID tuning rules should provide a greater degree of performance than the corresponding PI tuning rules, but may be less robust. Comparing the individual tuning rules, it is striking that the ISE based tuning rules have generally the smallest gain margin and have also a small phase margin, suggesting that this is a less robust tuning strategy. The results in Figures 4 and 7 confirm these comments.

Handbook of PI and PID Controller Tuning Rules

No general conclusion can be reached as to the best tuning rule (as expected); it is interesting, though, that a full panorama of simulation results (O'Dwyer, 2000) show that many tuning rules may be applied at ratios of time delay to time constant greater than that normally recommended. One example may be seen in Figures 5 to 7, where the gain margin, phase margin and maximum sensitivity (associated with the use of the PID tuning rule for obtaining minimum IAE in the regulator mode) tends to level out when the ratio of time delay to time constant is greater than 1; normally, the tuning rule is used when the ratio is less than 1 (Murrill, 1967). On the other hand, it is clear from Figures 8 and 9 that there is a significant degradation of performance when using the PID tuning rule of Witt and Waggoner (1990) and the PI tuning rule of Ziegler and Nichols (1942) for large ratios of time delay to time constant, which is compatible with application experience.
The decision between the use of a PI and PID controller to compensate the process, depends on the ratio of time delay to time constant in the FOLPD model, together with the desired trade-off between performance and robustness, as expected. It turns out, however, that the analytical method explored allows the calculation of a far wider range of gain and phase margins for PI controllers; it is also true that stability tends to be assured when a PI controller is used (O'Dwyer, 2000). Thus, a cautious design approach is to use a PI controller, particularly at larger ratios of time delay to time constant.
Finally, the volume of tuning rules and data generated means that the use of an expert system to recommend a tuning rule based on user defined requirements is indicated; work is ongoing on such an implementation (Feeney and O'Dwyer, 2002).

5.5 Design of Tuning Rules to Achieve Constant Gain and Phase Margins, for all Values of Delay

Normally, the gain and phase margins of the compensated systems tend to increase as the time delay increases, supporting the common view that PI and PID controllers are less suitable for the control of dominant time delay processes. However, for the PI control of a FOLPD process model, O'Dwyer (2000) shows that the tuning rules proposed by Chien et al. (1952), Haalman (1965) and Pemberton (1972a), among others, facilitate the achievement of a constant gain and phase margin as the time delay of the process model varies. All of these tuning rules have the following structure: K c = a T m / K m t m , T i = T m . Following this observation, original approaches to the design of tuning rules for PI, PD and PID controllers are proposed, for a wide variety of process models, which allow constant gain and phase margins for the compensated system.
This work organised as follows. In Section 5.5.1, PI controller tuning rules are specified for processes modelled in FOLPD form and IPD form. In Section 5.5.2, PID controller tuning rules are described for processes modelled in FOLPD form, SOSPD form and SOSPD form with a negative zero. Section 5.5.3 deals with the design of PD controller tuning rules for the control of processes modelled in FOLIPD form.

If Kc and T; are designed as follows: aT

and T;=Tm
Then Equation (5.12) becomes

(5.44)

-0.5n-copxm =-7t

(5.45)

i.e.

cop = 7i/2xm

(5.46)

Substituting Equation (5.46) into Equation (5.11) gives Am=7rTm/2KmKcTm
Substituting Equation (5.44) into Equation (5.10) gives

(5.47)

KmKc/cogTm=l

(5.48)

i.e.

cog=KmKc/Tm

(5.49)

Substituting Equations (5.44) and (5.49) into Equation (5.9) gives

(|>m=0.57t-KmKcTm/Tm

(5.50)

Finally, substituting Equation (5.43) into Equation (5.47) gives

Am=7r/2a
and substituting Equation (5.43) into Equation (5.50) gives (t>m =0.57t-a
Some typical tuning rules are shown in Table 186.

where Ku and Tu are the ultimate gain and ultimate period,

respectively, then the constant gain and phase margins provided in

Equations (5.51) and (5.52) are obtained.

5.5.1.2 Processes modelled in IPD form

A similar analysis to that of Section 5.5.1.1 may be done for the design

of PI controllers for processes modelled in IPD form. The process is

modelled as follows:

5.6 Conclusions
This chapter has considered the performance and robustness of a PI and PID controlled FOLPD process, with the parameters of the controllers determined by a variety of tuning rules. The original contributions of this work are as follows: (a) an expansion of the analytical approach of Ho et al. (1995b; 1996) to determine the approximate gain and phase margin analytically under all operating conditions (b) the analytical determination of the approximate maximum sensitivity of the compensated system and (c) the application of the algorithms using a wide variety of PI and PID tuning rules. The implementation of autotuning algorithms in commercial controllers means that choice of a suitable tuning rule is an important issue; the techniques discussed allow an analytical evaluation to be performed of candidate tuning rules.
Finally, the chapter discusses an original approach to design tuning rules for both PI and PID controllers, for a variety of delayed process models, with the objective of achieving constant gain and phase margins for all values of delay. In one of the cases discussed (PI control of an IPD process model), an analytical approximation is used in the development; this approximation may also be used to determine further tuning rules for other process models with delay, and for other PID controller structures.

Some Further Details on Process Modelling
Processes with time delay may be modelled in a variety of ways. The modelling strategy used will influence the value of the model parameters, which will in turn affect the controller values determined from the tuning rules. The modelling strategy used in association with each tuning rule, as described in the original papers, is indicated in the tables in Chapters 3 and 4. Some outline details of these modelling strategies are provided, together with the references that describe the modelling method in detail. The references are given in the bibliography. For all models, the label "Model: Method 1" indicates that the model method has not been defined or that the model parameters are assumed known. Of the 1134 tuning rules specified (442 PI controller tuning rules, 692 PID controller tuning rules), it is startling to relate that only 386 (or 34%) of tuning rules have been specified based on a defined process modelling method.

Handbook of
Controller Timing Rules
2nd Edition

. .ic vast majority ol automatic controllers used to compensate industrial processes arc ol I'l or I'll) type. This hook comprehensively compiles, using a unified notation, tuning rules for these controllers proposed
over the last sewn decades i 1935-2005). The tuning
rides are carefully categorized and application
information about each rule is given. The book
''·"·"sses controller architecture and process modeling
;. as well as the performance and robustness of
loops compensated with l'l or I'll) controllers. This
unique publication brings together in an easv-to-u.se
format material previously published in a large number
ol papers and hooks.

This wholly revised second edition extends the presentation ol l'l and I'll) controller tuning rules,
lor single variable processes with time delays, to include
additional rules compiled since the first edition was published in 2008.

Key Features · Addresses the needs of a niche market where no
comparable book is available A comprehensive compilation of PI and FID controller tuning rules
Makes the tuning rules easily accessible to researchers and practitioners through unified notation
Highlights the marked increase in the number of tuning rules compiled, from 600 in the first edition to 1,134 in this second edition
