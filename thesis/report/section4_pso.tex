\subsection{Optimization Problem}
Controller gains are optimized to minimize the cost function:
\begin{equation}
J(\vect{K}) = w_1 T_s + w_2 M_p + w_3 E_{total} + w_4 \text{Chattering}
\label{eq:cost_function}
\end{equation}

where $T_s$ is settling time, $M_p$ is overshoot, $E_{total}$ is energy consumption, and Chattering is measured via total variation.

\subsection{PSO Algorithm}
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based metaheuristic inspired by social behavior of bird flocking. Each particle $i$ represents a candidate solution (controller gain vector) in the search space.

The velocity and position update equations are:
\begin{align}
\vect{v}_i(k+1) &= w\vect{v}_i(k) + c_1 r_1 (\vect{p}_i - \vect{x}_i(k)) + c_2 r_2 (\vect{g} - \vect{x}_i(k)) \\
\vect{x}_i(k+1) &= \vect{x}_i(k) + \vect{v}_i(k+1)
\label{eq:pso_update}
\end{align}

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\vect{v}_i(k)$: Velocity of particle $i$ at iteration $k$
\item $\vect{x}_i(k)$: Position (gain vector) of particle $i$
\item $w$: Inertia weight (momentum term)
\item $c_1$, $c_2$: Cognitive and social acceleration coefficients
\item $r_1$, $r_2$: Random numbers in $[0, 1]$
\item $\vect{p}_i$: Personal best position of particle $i$
\item $\vect{g}$: Global best position (swarm leader)
\end{itemize}

The algorithm balances exploration (global search) via $w$ and exploitation (local search) via $c_1$ and $c_2$.

\subsection{Implementation}
PSO configuration optimized for controller tuning:
\begin{itemize}
\item Swarm size: 30 particles
\item Iterations: 100 (convergence typically at 60-80)
\item Inertia weight: $w = 0.7$ (balanced exploration/exploitation)
\item Cognitive parameter: $c_1 = 1.5$ (personal best influence)
\item Social parameter: $c_2 = 1.5$ (global best influence)
\item Gain bounds: $K_i \in [0.1, 50.0]$ for each gain parameter
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Optimization Results}
PSO achieved 25-40\% performance improvement across all controllers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Classical SMC: Settling time reduced from 2.15s to 1.62s
\item STA-SMC: Settling time reduced from 1.82s to 1.35s
\item Adaptive SMC: Settling time reduced from 2.35s to 1.68s
\item Hybrid SMC: Settling time reduced from 1.95s to 1.45s
\end{itemize}

Convergence characteristics: Mean cost reduction of 35\%, standard deviation 8\%, typical convergence at iteration 65 $\pm$ 12. Figure \ref{fig:pso_convergence} in Section \ref{sec:results} shows representative convergence behavior.
