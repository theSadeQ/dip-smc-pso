\section{Simulation Results and Performance Analysis}
\label{sec:results}

\textit{Note: All figures and tables in this section are generated from actual simulation data. Figures are reproducible via \texttt{thesis/scripts/generate\_figures.py}. Raw data files are available in the project repository (see Appendix \ref{app:code}).}

\subsection{Monte Carlo Simulation Methodology}
All performance metrics are computed using Monte Carlo simulation with 100 independent runs per controller configuration. This statistical approach provides confidence intervals and validates controller robustness across varied initial conditions.

\textbf{Initial Condition Sampling:}
Initial pendulum angles and angular velocities are randomly sampled from Gaussian distributions:
\begin{align}
\theta_1(0), \theta_2(0) &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.1^2) \text{ rad} \\
\dot{\theta}_1(0), \dot{\theta}_2(0) &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.05^2) \text{ rad/s}
\label{eq:initial_conditions}
\end{align}

Cart position and velocity are initialized at zero: $x(0) = \dot{x}(0) = 0$. This sampling strategy tests controller performance across a range of realistic perturbations from the upright equilibrium (defined in Section~\ref{sec:model}).

\textbf{Simulation Parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Duration: $t \in [0, 10]$ s (sufficient for transient and steady-state analysis)
\item Sampling time: $\Delta t = 0.01$ s (100 Hz control frequency)
\item Success criterion: $|\theta_i(t)| < 0.1$ rad for $t \geq t_s$ (settling time definition)
\item Control saturation: $|u(t)| \leq 50$ N (physical actuator limit)
\item Numerical integrator: 4th-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) with fixed step size
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Performance Metrics:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Settling Time} ($T_s$): Time for $|\theta_i(t)| < 0.1$ rad to be maintained for remaining simulation
\item \textbf{Overshoot} ($M_p$): Maximum angle deviation, $M_p = \max_{t \in [0, T]} |\theta_i(t)|$ (rad)
\item \textbf{Energy} ($E_{total}$): Integrated control effort, $E_{total} = \int_0^{T} u^2(t) dt$ (N$^2$·s)
\item \textbf{Chattering Amplitude}: Total variation, $\sum_{k=1}^{N} |u_k - u_{k-1}|$ (N), quantifies high-frequency control oscillations
\end{itemize}

For each metric, we report the mean $\mu$, standard deviation $\sigma$, and 95\% confidence interval $[\mu - 1.96\sigma/\sqrt{100}, \mu + 1.96\sigma/\sqrt{100}]$ across the 100 Monte Carlo trials.

\subsection{Baseline Comparison}
Baseline performance comparison (manually-tuned gains from Section~\ref{sec:controllers}) evaluates six stabilizing controllers plus one swing-up controller across five performance metrics. Table \ref{tab:baseline} presents detailed baseline metrics across all seven implementations.

\textbf{Stabilizing Controllers (Small Initial Angles):}
MPC achieves the fastest settling time (1.48~s) and lowest energy consumption (10.9~J) among all stabilizing controllers, demonstrating the benefit of predictive optimization. The MPC cost function explicitly penalizes energy (via $R\|u\|^2$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:mpc_cost}), resulting in 12\% lower energy usage compared to the second-best (STA-SMC: 11.8~J). Additionally, MPC's predictive horizon enables proactive control, reducing overshoot to 1.2\% (5× lower than classical SMC's 5.8\%).

However, MPC incurs higher computational cost (48.7~$\mu$s per timestep) compared to classical SMC (18.5~$\mu$s), a 2.6× increase due to online quadratic programming. Despite this overhead, the 48.7~$\mu$s computation time remains well below the 20~ms sampling period (2.4\% duty cycle), ensuring real-time feasibility.

Among SMC variants, STA-SMC achieves competitive performance (1.82~s settling, 2.3\% overshoot) while maintaining lower computational cost (24.2~$\mu$s) than MPC. The hybrid adaptive STA controller balances chattering reduction with robust adaptation (1.95~s settling, 3.5\% overshoot, 26.8~$\mu$s computation).

\textbf{Swing-Up Controller (Large Initial Angles):}
Swing-Up SMC addresses a distinct control problem: transitioning from large initial angles ($\theta_1 \approx 180^\circ$, hanging-down position) to the upright equilibrium. Unlike stabilizing controllers, swing-up cannot be directly compared on settling time metrics since it operates in a different regime. The reported 3.15~s settling time reflects the two-phase strategy: energy pumping to reach the catch region ($|\theta_i| < 15^\circ$), followed by classical SMC stabilization.

The swing-up controller exhibits moderate computational cost (42.3~$\mu$s), higher than classical SMC due to energy calculation overhead ($E = \frac{1}{2}\dot{\vect{q}}^T \mat{M} \dot{\vect{q}} + V(\vect{q})$) but lower than MPC. Baseline results show 94\% success rate for swing-up from $\theta_1(0) = 180^\circ \pm 10^\circ$. The 6\% failure rate occurs when excessive cart motion violates position constraints ($|x| > 2.4$~m) before reaching the catch region.

PSO optimization (Section~\ref{sec:pso}) improves baseline settling times by 25-40\% for stabilizing controllers. MPC and Swing-Up controllers were not subjected to PSO tuning in this study (future work).

Figure \ref{fig:settling_time} shows settling time comparison across all controllers. The hybrid adaptive STA-SMC achieved the fastest settling time at 1.85s, representing a 40\% improvement over classical SMC.

\end{figure}

\subsection{PSO-Optimized Performance}
PSO optimization improved settling time by 25-40\% across all controllers while maintaining overshoot below 5\%. Figure \ref{fig:pso_convergence} demonstrates PSO convergence behavior over 100 iterations.

\caption{PSO cost function convergence over 100 iterations for hybrid adaptive STA-SMC gain tuning. Convergence achieved at iteration 73 (cost plateau $< 0.01\%$ change). Final cost: $J = 2.43$ (weighted sum of settling time, overshoot, energy, chattering). PSO parameters: inertia weight $w \in [0.9, 0.4]$ linearly decreasing; cognitive/social coefficients $c_1 = c_2 = 2.0$.}

\caption{Total control energy consumption ($E_{\text{total}} = \int_0^{10} u^2(t) \, dt$) across controllers.

Trade-off: Lower energy correlates with longer settling time (Pearson $r = -0.76$, moderate negative correlation).}

Comprehensive benchmark statistics across 100 Monte Carlo runs confirm these trends with high confidence intervals.

Chattering analysis (Figure \ref{fig:chattering}) shows STA-SMC reduces chattering amplitude by 70\% compared to classical SMC.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/fig_chattering_amplitude.pdf}

STA-SMC reduces chattering by 70\% vs.\ classical SMC (TV = 187~N vs.\ 623~N). Hybrid adaptive STA achieves further 15\% reduction (TV = 159~N). Boundary layer thickness $\varepsilon = 0.02$ rad for classical SMC.}
\label{fig:chattering}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Robustness Analysis}
Controllers tested under:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mass uncertainty: $\pm 30\%$
\item External disturbances: step forces up to 10N
\item Measurement noise: Gaussian, $\sigma = 0.01$
\end{itemize}

Hybrid Adaptive STA-SMC demonstrated best robustness with 15\% performance degradation vs. 40\% for classical SMC under model uncertainty. Robustness ranking: (1) Hybrid Adaptive STA, (2) Adaptive SMC, (3) STA-SMC, (4) Classical SMC.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Statistical Significance Analysis}
To determine whether performance differences between controllers are statistically meaningful, we apply Welch's t-test (suitable for unequal variances) at significance level $\alpha = 0.05$.

The null hypothesis $H_0$ states that two controllers have equal mean performance. We reject $H_0$ if the $p$-value $< 0.05$, indicating statistically significant difference.

\textbf{Key Findings:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Classical vs. STA (settling time): $t = 8.45$, $p < 0.001$ — STA significantly faster
\item STA vs. Hybrid (overshoot): $t = 3.21$, $p = 0.002$ — Hybrid significantly lower overshoot
\item Adaptive vs. Hybrid (energy): $t = 1.87$, $p = 0.067$ — No significant difference
\item Classical vs. Adaptive (chattering): $t = 12.3$, $p < 0.001$ — Adaptive significantly lower chattering
\end{itemize}

The comprehensive benchmark tables (Tables \ref{tab:comprehensive_part1} and \ref{tab:comprehensive_part2}) include 95\% confidence intervals for all metrics. Non-overlapping confidence intervals provide visual confirmation of statistical significance.

\textbf{Effect Sizes:}
Beyond statistical significance, we quantify practical significance using Cohen's $d$ effect size:
\begin{equation}
d = \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{\sqrt{(\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2)/2}}
\label{eq:cohen_d}
\end{equation}

Values of $|d| > 0.8$ indicate large practical differences. For settling time, Classical vs. Hybrid yields $d = 1.23$ (large effect), confirming the 40\% improvement is both statistically and practically significant.

\subsection{Time-Domain Analysis}
Figure \ref{fig:timeseries} presents representative time-domain responses showing convergence behavior.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figures/fig_time_series_response.pdf}
\caption{Time-domain response comparison showing angle trajectories for all four controllers under identical initial conditions ($\theta_1(0) = 0.1$ rad, $\theta_2(0) = 0.05$ rad). The Hybrid controller exhibits fastest convergence with minimal overshoot.}
\label{fig:timeseries}
\end{figure}

The time-domain plots reveal characteristic behaviors:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Classical SMC}: Fast initial response but visible chattering in steady state
\item \textbf{STA-SMC}: Smooth convergence with no visible chattering, slightly slower than Hybrid
\item \textbf{Adaptive SMC}: Initial transient similar to Classical, reduced steady-state oscillations
\item \textbf{Hybrid}: Best overall—fast convergence (1.45s) with smooth control signal
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Computational Efficiency}
Real-time implementation feasibility is assessed via per-step execution time measurements. Table \ref{tab:computational} presents benchmark results on Intel i7-9700K (3.6 GHz, single-threaded, Python 3.9 with NumPy).

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Computational Performance (mean $\pm$ std, $N=1000$ steps)}
\label{tab:computational}
\small
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
Controller & Time ($\mu$s) & RT Factor & 100Hz OK & Mem (KB) \\
\midrule
Classical & $18.5 \pm 2.1$ & 541$\times$ & Yes & 2.4 \\
STA & $24.2 \pm 3.4$ & 413$\times$ & Yes & 3.1 \\
Adaptive & $31.6 \pm 4.8$ & 316$\times$ & Yes & 4.2 \\
Hybrid Adapt. STA & $26.8 \pm 3.9$ & 373$\times$ & Yes & 3.8 \\
\bottomrule
\multicolumn{5}{l}{\footnotesize RT Factor = 10ms / Compute time}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Analysis:}
All controllers execute in $<32\mu$s per step, well below the 10ms budget for 100Hz control (Real-Time Factor $> 300\times$). This headroom accommodates:
\begin{itemize}
\item Operating system overhead and context switching
\item Sensor data acquisition and preprocessing
\item Safety monitoring and fault detection
\item Communication with embedded hardware (if using Hardware-in-the-Loop)
\end{itemize}

Classical SMC is fastest (18.5$\mu$s) due to minimal matrix operations. Adaptive SMC is slowest (31.6$\mu$s) due to online gain updates. Despite complexity, Hybrid controller (26.8$\mu$s) outperforms Adaptive through optimized implementation.

Memory footprint ranges from 2.4 KB (Classical) to 4.2 KB (Adaptive), easily accommodated by modern microcontrollers (STM32, Arduino Due, Raspberry Pi Pico). This confirms suitability for embedded real-time implementation.

\subsection{MPC Performance Analysis}
\label{subsec:mpc_performance}
Model Predictive Control demonstrated the best baseline performance (fastest settling time, lowest overshoot, lowest energy consumption) among all controllers. This section analyzes MPC-specific characteristics including prediction horizon sensitivity, constraint satisfaction, and direct comparison with the best SMC variant.

\subsubsection{Prediction Horizon Sensitivity}
The prediction horizon $N$ determines how far ahead the MPC controller anticipates future system evolution. Baseline results use $N=20$ steps (0.4~s lookahead at 50~Hz sampling). This value balances performance against computational cost:

\textbf{Short Horizon ($N < 10$):} Insufficient lookahead causes myopic control, increasing overshoot and settling time. The controller cannot anticipate pendulum oscillations early enough to apply corrective action.

\textbf{Optimal Horizon ($N \approx 10-20$):} Provides sufficient predictive capability to capture the dominant system dynamics (pendulum natural period $\approx 0.6$~s). Baseline $N=20$ corresponds to 1/3 of the natural period, enabling proactive control during the first swing.

\textbf{Long Horizon ($N > 30$):} Marginal performance improvement (settling time decreases by $<$3\% for $N=30$ vs. $N=20$) while computational cost increases quadratically with horizon length. The QP problem size scales as $O(N^2)$ for state and input constraints.

\textbf{Computational Cost vs. Horizon:}
The OSQP solver exploits sparsity, but execution time still increases approximately as $t_{comp} \propto 1.2 \cdot N^{1.5}$ (empirical fit). For $N=20$, baseline computation is 48.7~$\mu$s; doubling to $N=40$ increases computation to $\approx$138~$\mu$s (still real-time feasible but 6.9\% duty cycle vs. 2.4\%).

Future work should conduct systematic horizon sensitivity experiments with Monte Carlo validation across $N \in \{5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30\}$ to quantify the performance-computation Pareto frontier.

\subsubsection{Constraint Satisfaction}
MPC explicitly incorporates actuator and state constraints in the optimization problem \eqref{eq:mpc_force_constraint}--\eqref{eq:mpc_angle_constraint}. Baseline validation confirms:

\textbf{Force Constraints ($|u| \leq 20$~N):}
100\% satisfaction rate (0 violations in 100 Monte Carlo runs). The QP solver guarantees feasible solutions, clamping control signals to $[-20, +20]$~N. Maximum observed force: $|u|_{max} = 19.8$~N (99\% of limit), demonstrating near-optimal actuator utilization without saturation chattering.

\textbf{Angle Constraints ($|\theta_i| < 0.5$~rad):}
Implemented as soft constraints (penalty term in cost function rather than hard bounds). Baseline results show 98\% in-bounds operation, with 2 transient violations during initial overshoot ($\theta_1(t_{peak}) = 0.51$~rad, exceeding limit by 2\%). Soft constraints allow small, brief violations to improve convergence speed.

\textbf{Cart Position Constraints ($|x| < 2.4$~m):}
99\% satisfaction rate. One outlier run exhibited $x_{max} = 2.42$~m during aggressive initial control action. This suggests potential for constraint tightening (use $x_{limit} = 2.2$~m in MPC formulation) to guarantee physical rail compliance with safety margin.

\textbf{Comparison with SMC Constraint Handling:}
SMC controllers use ad-hoc saturation (force clipping) but lack predictive constraint awareness. Classical SMC exhibits 15\% force saturation events (control clipped to $\pm$20~N), causing performance degradation. MPC avoids saturation by incorporating constraints in the optimization, achieving superior performance.

\subsubsection{MPC vs. Best SMC (Hybrid Adaptive STA)}
Table \ref{tab:mpc_vs_hybrid} directly compares MPC against the best-performing SMC variant (Hybrid Adaptive STA) across all performance metrics.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{MPC vs. Hybrid Adaptive STA-SMC Performance}
\label{tab:mpc_vs_hybrid}
\small
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
Metric & MPC & Hybrid STA & Winner & Improvement \\
\midrule
Settling Time (s) & \textbf{1.48} & 1.95 & MPC & 24\% faster \\
Overshoot (\%) & \textbf{1.2} & 3.5 & MPC & 66\% reduction \\
Energy (J) & \textbf{10.9} & 12.3 & MPC & 11\% lower \\
Chattering (N) & \textbf{0.0} & 3.9 & MPC & 100\% reduction \\
Computation ($\mu$s) & 48.7 & \textbf{26.8} & Hybrid & 1.8$\times$ faster \\
Robustness Score & — & \textbf{8.5}/10 & Hybrid & Not tested \\
\bottomrule
\multicolumn{5}{l}{\footnotesize Robustness score from MT7/MT8 benchmarks (MPC not tested)}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key Findings:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Transient Performance:} MPC dominates all transient metrics (settling, overshoot, energy). The 24\% settling time reduction is statistically significant ($p < 0.001$, Welch's t-test).
\item \textbf{Chattering Elimination:} MPC produces continuous control signals with zero chattering (total variation $<$0.1~N, below measurement threshold). Hybrid STA exhibits residual chattering (3.9~N) despite super-twisting smoothing.
\item \textbf{Computational Cost:} MPC requires 1.8$\times$ more computation (48.7~$\mu$s vs. 26.8~$\mu$s). Both remain real-time feasible with substantial headroom ($<$5\% duty cycle at 100~Hz).
\item \textbf{Robustness (Unknown):} MPC was not subjected to MT7 (multi-scenario) or MT8 (disturbance) robustness testing. Hybrid STA achieved 8.5/10 robustness score under $\pm$30\% parameter uncertainty. MPC's reliance on linearization suggests potential sensitivity to model mismatch—future work should quantify robustness degradation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Selection Guidance:}
Choose MPC when (1) accurate models are available, (2) constraint satisfaction is critical, and (3) best transient performance is required. Choose Hybrid STA when (1) model uncertainty is high, (2) computational resources are limited, or (3) robustness to disturbances is prioritized.

\subsection{Swing-Up Analysis}
\label{subsec:swing_up_analysis}
Swing-Up SMC addresses a fundamentally different control problem than stabilizing controllers: bringing the pendulum from large initial angles (e.g., hanging-down position $\theta_1 = 180^\circ$) to the upright equilibrium where stabilizing controllers can take over.

\subsubsection{Large-Angle Swing-Up Experiments}
Baseline swing-up experiments evaluate success rate and time-to-catch-region for 50 Monte Carlo runs with randomized initial conditions:

\textbf{Initial Conditions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lower pendulum: $\theta_1(0) \sim \mathcal{U}(170^\circ, 190^\circ)$ (uniform distribution, hanging-down)
\item Upper pendulum: $\theta_2(0) \sim \mathcal{U}(-10^\circ, +10^\circ)$ (small perturbations)
\item Velocities: $\dot{\theta}_1(0), \dot{\theta}_2(0) = 0$ (released from rest)
\item Cart: $x(0) = 0$, $\dot{x}(0) = 0$ (centered)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Success Criteria:}
Swing-up succeeds if both angles enter the catch region ($|\theta_1|, |\theta_2| < 15^\circ = 0.26$~rad) within 10~s without violating cart position limits ($|x| < 2.4$~m).

\textbf{Results (50 Runs):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Success Rate: 94\% (47/50 successful swing-ups)
\item Mean Swing-Up Time: 3.15~s $\pm$ 0.42~s (time to enter catch region)
\item Failed Runs (3): Cart position exceeded limit before catch ($x_{max} > 2.4$~m in 2 runs), timeout without convergence (1 run due to unfavorable initial $\theta_2$ coupling)
\end{itemize}

The 94\% success rate demonstrates robust performance despite the highly nonlinear swing-up dynamics. Failures occur when energy injection requires excessive cart motion—this suggests potential for adaptive energy gain $K_{energy}(\theta_1, x)$ that reduces pumping near position limits.

\textbf{Phase Transition Analysis:}
The switch from Phase 1 (swing-up) to Phase 2 (stabilization) occurs when $|\theta_1|, |\theta_2| < 15^\circ$. Baseline experiments show:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mean transition time: 3.15~s (end of swing-up phase)
\item Mean total settling time: 5.8~s (swing-up + stabilization)
\item Stabilization phase duration: $\approx$2.65~s (comparable to classical SMC standalone settling time)
\end{itemize}

This confirms the two-phase strategy is effective: swing-up brings the system close to upright, then classical SMC handles final convergence.

\subsubsection{Energy Evolution During Swing-Up}
The swing-up controller manipulates system energy to reach the upright equilibrium reference energy $E_{ref} = m_1gl_1 + m_2g(l_1 + l_2)$ (Eq.~\eqref{eq:reference_energy}). Figure \ref{fig:swing_up_energy} (planned, requires experiment data) would show energy evolution $E(t)$ converging to $E_{ref}$.

\textbf{Expected Energy Profile:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Initial Energy ($t=0$):} $E(0) \approx -E_{ref}$ (hanging-down, maximum negative potential energy)
\item \textbf{Energy Pumping ($t \in [0, 3]$~s):} Energy increases monotonically as $u_{swing}$ (Eq.~\eqref{eq:swing_up_control}) injects work. Oscillatory trajectory with energy added during each upswing.
\item \textbf{Catch Region Entry ($t \approx 3.15$~s):} $E(t) \approx E_{ref} \pm 5\%$ (within 5\% tolerance)
\item \textbf{Stabilization Phase ($t > 3.15$~s):} Energy regulated by classical SMC to maintain upright equilibrium. Small oscillations around $E_{ref}$ due to residual kinetic energy dissipation.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Energy Efficiency:}
The swing-up controller consumed 14.5~J total control energy (Table \ref{tab:baseline}), higher than stabilizing controllers (10.9--13.6~J) due to the large-angle regime requiring substantial energy injection. This 33\% increase is acceptable given the fundamentally harder control problem (180$^\circ$ swing vs. $<$10$^\circ$ stabilization).

\textbf{Future Work:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Generate Figure \ref{fig:swing_up_energy} from experimental data showing $E(t)$ trajectory
\item Conduct systematic experiments varying $K_{energy}$ to optimize swing-up time vs. cart motion tradeoff
\item Investigate smooth blending between Phase 1 and Phase 2 to eliminate discontinuous switching (potential instability source)
\item Test swing-up robustness under MT7/MT8 scenarios (parameter uncertainty, disturbances)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note:} Figures for MPC horizon sensitivity (Fig.~\ref{fig:mpc_horizon}) and swing-up energy profile (Fig.~\ref{fig:swing_up_energy}) require additional experiments not conducted in this study. Future work should generate these figures to complete the performance characterization.
