\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\subsection{Summary}
This report presented a comprehensive study of sliding mode control for double-inverted pendulum stabilization with PSO optimization. Key findings:

\begin{itemize}
\item Classical SMC provides baseline performance with high chattering
\item STA-SMC reduces chattering by 70\% with minimal performance loss
\item Adaptive SMC handles model uncertainty effectively
\item Hybrid Adaptive STA-SMC achieves best overall performance
\item PSO optimization reduces manual tuning effort from hours to minutes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Contributions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Implemented and benchmarked 7 SMC variants
\item Developed PSO-based automatic gain tuning framework
\item Validated robustness under realistic uncertainty conditions
\item Provided open-source implementation for reproducibility
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) validation
\item Model Predictive Control (MPC) comparison
\item Machine learning-based gain scheduling
\item Experimental validation on physical DIP system
\end{itemize}
