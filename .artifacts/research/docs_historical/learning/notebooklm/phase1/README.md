### TTS Optimization Examples

**Before (Markdown)**:
```python
def calculate_area(length, width):
    return length * width
```

**After (TTS-Optimized Narration)**:
```
Let's define a function. Type:
d-e-f space calculate underscore area open-parenthesis length comma space width close-parenthesis colon
Then press Enter.
Four spaces indent, then type:
return space length space asterisk space width
```

**Before (Math)**:
```
θ̇ = ω = dθ/dt
```

**After (TTS-Optimized)**:
```
theta-dot equals omega, which equals d-theta over d-t. In words: the angular velocity is the rate of change of angle with respect to time.
```

## Troubleshooting

### NotebookLM Issues

**Problem**: Audio sounds robotic or mispronounces terms

**Solution**:
- Check markdown for phonetic spellings (e.g., "c-d" not "cd")
- Add pronunciation guide section if missing
- Spell out math/code phonetically

**Problem**: Episode too long (>30 min audio)

**Solution**:
- Split episode into Part 1 and Part 2
- Each part should target 2,500-3,500 words
- Maintain narrative flow across parts

**Problem**: Can't upload markdown to NotebookLM

**Solution**:
- Ensure file is .md format (not .txt or .docx)
- Check file size <100 MB (our files are ~10-15 KB each)
- Try uploading one episode at a time instead of all 11

### Learning Issues

**Problem**: Can't follow along with code examples

**Solution**:
- Pause NotebookLM audio at code sections
- Open VS Code and type along
- Refer to detailed roadmap for full code listings

**Problem**: Concepts still confusing after listening

**Solution**:
- Replay episode sections (NotebookLM allows scrubbing)
- Read detailed roadmap: `docs/learning/beginner-roadmap/phase-1-foundations.md`
- Ask questions in GitHub Discussions or community forums

**Problem**: Moving too fast through material

**Solution**:
- Slow down! No rush. Understanding > speed
- Spend multiple days on each episode
- Practice exercises between episodes
- Use "Pause and Reflect" questions as checkpoints

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I listen to episodes out of order?**
A: Not recommended. Episodes build on each other sequentially. Skipping ahead may cause confusion.

**Q: How long does each episode take to generate in NotebookLM?**
A: 2-5 minutes per episode. You can generate all 11 at once in a single notebook.

**Q: Can I share the audio files?**
A: Yes! NotebookLM allows downloading MP3s. Share with classmates or study groups.

**Q: Do I need the full 40 hours from the roadmap?**
A: The podcast (3.5-4 hours) covers concepts. The 40 hours includes hands-on practice, exercises, and projects. Both are valuable but serve different purposes.

**Q: What if I already know some of this material?**
A: Use the diagnostic self-assessments. Skip episodes where you score 4/5 or higher without reviewing content.

**Q: What happens after Phase 1?**
A: Progress to Phase 2 (control theory) via the Phase 2 NotebookLM podcast series or the detailed roadmap.

**Q: Can I use this for a university course?**
A: Absolutely! This series complements traditional coursework. Perfect for commutes or review sessions.
