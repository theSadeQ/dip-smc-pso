Compared with the existing sliding-mode controllers, the noteworthy contributions of two finite-time controllers in the proposed CNTSMC-ISS framework are the alleviation of the chattering phenomenon, the fast finite-time stability, and the singularity-free and ease-of-implementation characteristics. In the proposed CNTSMC-ISS framework, we first introduce a nonsingular integral terminal sliding-mode surface (NITSMS) such that the finite-time convergence of the system states to zero in the sliding phase is ensured and the singularity problem is avoided. Besides, a finite-time observer is developed to recover the external disturbance. Then, based on the constructed NITSMS with the supertwisting-like algorithm, the state feedback CNTSMC-ISS and the disturbance-observer-based CNTSMC-ISS are proposed, which generate the continuous control signals and guarantee the fast finite-time convergence of the system states to the designed sliding surface. Rigorous finite-time stability of the closed-loop system under two proposed controllers is provided. Finally, we apply two finite-time controllers in the proposed CNTSMC-ISS framework to the attitude control for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles under external disturbances. Extensive simulation and experimental results are illustrated to prove the effectiveness of the proposed attitude controllers.",

First, a terminal integral sliding variable is designed. Based on the finite\u2010time concept, an adaptive control law has been developed in which a switching gain is adjusted adaptively by using a novel strategy. This control method aims to deal with unknown bounded disturbances and uncertainties. Moreover, it allows fast convergence of the system states to an equilibrium point. The main features of the proposed ATISMC are its robustness, fast convergence rate, and chattering avoidance. To realize trajectory tracking for WMR, the ATISMC is incorporated into a double closed loop scheme. Stability analysis is performed using the Lyapunov stability theory. Numerical simulations and real\u2010time experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed controller scheme. A comparison study with the classical ISMC was performed to show the superiority of the developed method.",

The sliding mode controller can deal with any wind speed, ingrained nonlinearities in the system, external disturbances and model uncertainties, yet the chattering phenomenon that characterizes classical SMC can be destructive. This problem is suitably lessened by adopting adaptive fuzzy-SMC. For this proposed approach, the adaptive switching gains are adjusted by a supervisory fuzzy logic system, so the chattering impact is avoided.

Specifically, a dynamic model of PMLSM with lumped uncertainty is established by considering the tracking task involving parameter variations, disturbance load, etc. Then, based on the dynamic model, a FBLFTSM control law is designed to guarantee higher tracking accuracy of the surface motion than the classical terminal sliding mode control even if the system suffers from unknown disturbance. Meanwhile, the fractional-order boundary layer control has the feature of \u201clarge error turns into large gain, small error turns into small gain,\u201d which solves the contradiction between weak chattering and fast convergence in the integer-order boundary layer control and improves the dynamic performance of the system. Finally, the effectiveness of the control approach is verified by conducting tracking experiments on the cSPACE-based motor platform.",
