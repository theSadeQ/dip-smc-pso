An orbifold pair\nhas $c_i=1/n_i$, as intersecting with a small sphere gives a $3$-dimensional\norbifold $(\\Sigma, \\gamma_i,n_i)$. There are natural notions of morphism and\nlog cover of surface pairs. We introduce a volume $Vol(X,C)$ in $\\mathbb\nQ_{\\geq 0}$, computable from any log resolution, analogous to that in our 1990\nJAMS paper when $C=0$. Denoting $\\bar{C}=\\sum (1-c_i)C_i$, one has $(X,C)$ log\ncanonical iff $Vol(X,\\bar{C})=0$. The main theorem (5.4-5.6) is that $Vol(X,C)$\nis ``characteristic'': if $f:(X',C')\\rightarrow (X,C)$ is a morphism of degree\n$d$, then $Vol(X',C')\\geq d\\cdot Vol(X,C)$, with equality if $f$ is a log\ncover. We prove (6.7) that $Vol(X,\\sum (1/n_i)C_i)=0$ iff the associated\norbifold has finite or solvable orbifold fundamental group, and these are\nclassified. In (8.2) is proved a key case of the DCC Volumes Conjecture: The\nset $\\{Vol(X,\\sum (1/n_i)C_i)|\\ X\\ \\text{RDP}\\}$ satisfies the DCC, with\nminimum non-$0$ volume 1/3528.",

An\nexpression for the perturbation energy exchange term between the fluid and\nporous layers is derived by integrating the perturbation equation for the\nporous layer which is then used to prove the propositions. The necessary and\nsufficient condition for the existence of the instability in flows through\ncylindrical geometries is shown to be $\\frac{d}{dr} \\left( \\frac{r\n\\frac{dV}{dr}}{n^2+k^2 r^2} \\right) (V-V_I)<0$ somewhere in the flow where $V$\nand $V_I$ are the axisymmetric base-state velocity profile and velocity at the\nfluid-porous layer interface, respectively. The parameters, $k$ and $n$ are the\naxial and azimuthal wavenumbers, respectively. Additionally, the bounds on the\nphase speed ($c_r$) and growth rate ($k c_i$) are derived.\n  The derived propositions are used to determine the stability of the sliding\nCouette, annular Poiseuille, and Hagen-Poiseuille flows with a porous wall. The\nanalysis reveals, for the first time, the existence of both axisymmetric\n($n=0$) and non-axisymmetric ($n\\neq 0$) modes of instability in all three\nflows. The Hagen--Poiseuille flow through a tube with a non-porous wall is\nlinearly stable. Therefore, the instability predicted here is solely due to the\nporous nature of the wall. The mechanism responsible for the predicted\ninstability is the exchange of the perturbation energy between the fluid and\nporous layers.",

To handle large non-linearities directly, sliding mode controller based\non PID-type sliding surface has been designed in this work, where Integral term\nensures fast finite convergence time. The controller parameter for various\nmodified structures can be estimated using Modified PSO, which is used as an\noffline optimization technique. Various reaching law were implemented leading\nto the proposed improved exponential power rate reaching law, which also\nimproves the finite convergence time. To implement the proposed algorithm,\nnonlinear mathematical model has to be decrypted without linearizing, and used\nfor the simulation purposes. Their performance is studied using simulations to\nprove the proposed behavior. The problem of chattering has been overcome by\nusing boundary method and also second order sliding mode method. PI-type\nsliding surface based second order sliding mode controller with PD surface\nbased SMC compensation is also proposed and implemented. The proposed\nalgorithms have been analyzed using Lyapunov stability criteria. The robustness\nof the method is provided using simulation results including disturbance and\n10% variation in system parameters. Finally process control based hardware is\nimplemented (conical tank system).",

            "abstract": "The sliding mode controller is a highly effective nonlinear control design approach that can enhance system performance and robustness. The core concept of this approach is to drive the state variables of the system toward a sliding surface that represents the desired location. This study focuses on designing a sliding mode controller to improve the tracking performance and achieve stability for the desired Euler angles (pitch, yaw, and roll) of a satellite. Nonlinear simulations are conducted to investigate the robustness of the sliding mode control design method under the influence of coupling due to pitch, yaw, and roll rates, as well as time delay through the feedback angles. The convergence of the rate of change of the Lyapunov function to zero is demonstrated to ensure system stability. The simulation results highlight the effectiveness of the sliding mode controller in suppressing the impact of time delay dynamics, in contrast to the classical proportional derivative control design approach, which results in instability. Overall, the study showcases the potential of the sliding mode controller to improve system performance and robustness in nonlinear control systems.",

In practical scenarios, exact cancellation of system nonlinearities is often infeasible due to limited model information and unpredictable disturbances. To address this challenge, sliding mode control (SMC) is adapted to a data\u2010driven setting to ensure robust stability. The proposed framework comprises two key components: a data\u2010driven robust controller that drives the system state trajectories to a predefined sliding surface, and a nominal controller, synthesized via data\u2010driven semidefinite programming (SDP), to maintain stable sliding motion. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art data\u2010driven control approaches based on approximate nonlinearity cancellation, as well as the classical Deep Q\u2010Network (DQN) reinforcement learning algorithm, achieving superior robustness and stabilization performance.",

            "abstract": "Abstract We study the dynamics of dilute, slightly negatively buoyant, millimetre-size spherical particles fully suspended in a smooth-wall open channel flow. The Reynolds number is $Re_{\\tau } = 570$ and the particle Stokes number is ${{\\textit {St}}}^{+} = 15$. Particle image velocimetry and tracking are used to obtain simultaneous, time-resolved flow fields and particle trajectories. Particles travel at a lower mean velocity than the fluid: in the log layer this is due to the oversampling of slow fluid regions, but closer to the wall the cause is instantaneous slip between particles and fluid. The particle Reynolds stresses exceed those of the fluid. Near the wall, the particle streamwise diffusivity is larger than the momentum diffusivity, while the opposite is true for the wall-normal component. The particle transport is strongly linked to ejections, while the role of sweeps is marginal, and there is no evidence of turbophoresis. The concentration profile follows a power law with a shallower slope than predicted by equilibrium theories that neglect particle inertia. Upward-/downward-moving particles display positive/negative mean streamwise acceleration due to the particle\u2013fluid slip. The particles that contact the wall are faster than the local fluid both before reaching the wall and after leaving it. Therefore, they are decelerated by drag and pushed downward by shear-induced lift. The durations of wall contact follow exponential distributions with characteristic time scale close to the particle response time. Lift-offs coincide with particles meeting a fluid ejection. These observations emphasize the competing effects of inertia and gravity.",

            "abstract": "Abstract A combination of time-resolved tomographic particle image velocimetry, refractive index matching technique and machine vision algorithms was used to measure the translational and rotational motion of freely moving, nearly neutrally buoyant spheres in a fully developed turbulent boundary layer (TBL). Located in the buffer and logarithmic layers, the hydrogel spheres ($\\sim$70 inner wall units in diameter) were refractive index matched with the water and tagged by \u2018spokes\u2019. Besides translational motion, the spheres exhibited significant rotation. The spheres were surrounded by typical coherent structures observed in TBLs, among them hairpin packets and transverse and longitudinal vortices that induced ejections and sweeps. While the majority of instantaneous sphere Reynolds numbers did not exceed 100, and vortex shedding was not observed, the results showed that the spheres may affect the evolution of hairpin packets in TBLs due to their finite size. The instantaneous rotation-, wall- and shear-induced lift forces, as well as the drag forces, acting on the spheres were estimated using available correlations for the lift and drag coefficients. Results hinted at negative shear-induced lift due to flow separation at a smaller critical Reynolds number than incorporated in the correlations that do not include the effect of ambient turbulence. The results indicated further that the drag force aided by the rotation-induced lift force was instrumental in keeping one of the spheres aloft. For the wall-ward moving spheres, lift forces opposed sphere motion. As a result, the spheres approached the wall with velocities lower than their quiescent settling velocity.",
