This can be seen\nas predictability, which underlies fairness. Unfortunately, the existence of\nsuch averages cannot be guaranteed with many traditional regulators, including\nthe proportional-integral (PI) regulator with or without deadband. Here, we\nconsider the effects of losses in the alternating current model and the\ndeadband in the controller. This yields a non-linear dynamical system (due to\nthe non-linear losses) exhibiting discontinuities (due to the deadband).

We specifically examine\nthe effects that frequency switching, i.e., instantaneously changing the\noscillation frequency of the temperature gradient, has on the shape of the heat\ntransport hysteresis curves generated by a particle connected to two thermal\nbaths, each with a temperature that is oscillating in time. Analytical\nexpressions are derived for the energy fluxes in/out of the system and the\nbaths, with excellent agreement observed between the analytical expressions and\nthe results from nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. We find that\nthe shape of the heat transport hysteresis curves can be significantly altered\nby shifting the frequency between fast and slow oscillation regimes.

            "abstract": "In this paper we provide a rigorous convergence analysis for the renowned particle swarm optimization method by using tools from stochastic calculus and the analysis of partial differential equations. Based on a continuous-time formulation of the particle dynamics as a system of stochastic differential equations, we establish convergence to a global minimizer of a possibly nonconvex and nonsmooth objective function in two steps. First, we prove consensus formation of an associated mean-field dynamics by analyzing the time-evolution of the variance of the particle distribution, which acts as Lyapunov function of the dynamics. We then show that this consensus is close to a global minimizer by employing the asymptotic Laplace principle and a tractability condition on the energy landscape of the objective function. These results allow for the usage of memory mechanisms, and hold for a rich class of objectives provided certain conditions of well-preparation of the hyperparameters and the initial datum. In a second step, at least for the case without memory effects, we provide a quantitative result about the mean-field approximation of particle swarm optimization, which specifies the convergence of the interacting particle system to the associated mean-field limit. Combining these two results allows for global convergence guarantees of the numerical particle swarm optimization method with provable polynomial complexity. To demonstrate the applicability of the method we propose an efficient and parallelizable implementation, which is tested in particular on a competitive and well-understood high-dimensional benchmark problem in machine learning.",

The algorithm exploits the evaluation time gradient in addition to the convergence gradient attempting to reach the same convergence precision following a more economical path. The particle's newly incorporated time information is usually in contradiction to the past memories of best function evaluations thus degrading convergence. A technique is proposed in order to modulate the new cognitive input that consists of progressive reducing of its weight in order to confer the algorithm the appropriate time\u2010convergence balance. Results show that the proposed algorithm not only provides computational economy, but also unexpectedly improves convergence per se due to a better exploration in the initial stages of optimization. Its application in asymptotic homogenization of a cracked poroelastic medium confirms its superior performance compared to a series of alternative optimization algorithms. The proposed algorithm improvement allows to extend the applicability of PSO and PSO\u2010based algorithms to problems that were previously thought to be too computationally expensive for population\u2010based approaches.",

            "abstract": "In the era of continuous development in Internet of Things (IoT) technology, smart services are penetrating various facets of societal life, leading to a growing demand for interconnected devices. Many contemporary devices are no longer mere data producers but also consumers of data. As a result, massive amounts of data are transmitted to the cloud, but the latency generated in edge-to-cloud communication is unacceptable for many tasks. In response to this, this paper introduces a novel contribution\u2014a layered computing network built on the principles of fog computing, accompanied by a newly devised algorithm designed to optimize user tasks and allocate computing resources within rechargeable networks. The proposed algorithm, a synergy of Lyapunov-based, dynamic Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), allows for predictive task allocation. The fog servers dynamically train LSTM networks to effectively forecast the data features of user tasks, facilitating proper unload decisions based on task priorities. In response to the challenge of slower hardware upgrades in edge devices compared to user demands, the algorithm optimizes the utilization of low-power devices and addresses performance limitations. Additionally, this paper considers the unique characteristics of rechargeable networks, where computing nodes acquire energy through charging. Utilizing Lyapunov functions for dynamic resource control enables nodes with abundant resources to maximize their potential, significantly reducing energy consumption and enhancing overall performance. The simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm surpasses traditional methods in terms of energy efficiency and resource allocation optimization. Despite the limitations of prediction accuracy in Fog Servers (FS), the proposed results significantly promote overall performance. The proposed approach improves the efficiency and the user experience of Internet of Things systems in terms of latency and energy consumption.",

Both algorithms are evaluated on the basis of their reduction and stabilisation of the root mean square error (RMSE) between the robot\u2019s desired and actual trajectories. An implementation of the robot\u2019s dynamic motion is provided. The robot\u2019s mass and inertia are considered. The robot\u2019s settings and the viscosity of the surroundings present a few obstacles to following the specified path. For each algorithm, the proportional (Kp) and derivative (Kd) parameters of the controller are optimised, and the convergence speeds and stabilities of the controllers are compared. The results show that both algorithms perform comparably. However, the QPSO method converges faster and is more stable at optimal Kp and Kd values. The ramifications of this research extend beyond trajectory tracking. Enhanced optimisation approaches can lead to higher performance in a variety of robotic systems, including autonomous cars, drones, and automation systems, by employing advanced quantum algorithms, such as QPSO.",

            "abstract": "The dynamics of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are often nonlinear, especially at high speed and high maneuverability flight. The inherent nonlinearity of the system renders conventional linear control techniques inadequate for achieving optimal control outcomes. Consequently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory planning is fundamentally a nonlinear optimal control challenge, characterized by the difficulty of swiftly obtaining a stable solution and the propensity to converge on suboptimal local solutions during the solving process. In response to this, a method for autonomous UAV obstacle avoidance trajectory planning is introduced, leveraging a convex optimization-based particle swarm algorithm. The UAV uses sensors to record the information about obstacles, adopts a one-dimensional time-parameterized polynomial trajectory to construct the obstacle avoidance control input, combines the safety penalty function between the navigation path and obstacles to generate the obstacle avoidance trajectory planning objective function, and obtains the path points in the obstacle avoidance trajectory; the particle swarm algorithm is used to solve the objective function, the parameters such as obstacle avoidance control input and safety penalty function are used as particles, and the optimal parameter values are obtained through the iterative updating process of position and speed. Aiming at the acquired obstacle avoidance trajectory path points, the convex optimization algorithm is used to construct a non-convex optimal control model that meets the requirements of energy optimization, and is rooted in the concave-convex process, so that the control model\u2019s objective function and inequality constraint are both convex, while the formula constraint is affine. By transforming the control model into a convex optimization problem, it aligns with the energy optimization requirements. The sequential convex optimization framework is employed to solve this problem, enabling the optimization of the UAV\u2019s trajectory for obstacle avoidance. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that this approach effectively captures the coordinate details of obstacles, navigates through various dense obstacle scenarios, and simultaneously guarantees an energy-efficient path to the target destination.",

            "abstract": "What makes populations stabilize? What makes them fluctuate? Are populations in complex ecosystems more stable than populations in simple ecosystems? In \uf731\uf739\uf737\uf733, Robert May addressed these questions in this monograph that has since become a classic. Trained as a theoretical physicist, May used mathematical modeling to investigate the stability and complexity of a community of interacting plants and animals, following the food web as a clue. Contrary to general biological thinking, he showed in population dynamics models that population equilibrium was less likely to destabilize such ecosystems when the number of species is increased and species interactions are randomly added. In the quarter century since its publication, the book\u2019s message has grown in power. Stability and Complexity in Model Ecosystems played a key role in introducing nonlinear mathematical models, along with the study of deterministic chaos, to ecologists\u2014as science writer James Gleick would chronicle in his best-seller Chaos. Nonlinear models are now at the center of ecological thinking, and current threats to biodiversity have made questions about the role of ecosystem complexity more crucial than ever. This book launched a career of mathematical insight into some of life\u2019s biggest questions. Robert May has gone on to apply mathematical modeling to other biological problems. He has modeled the current state of biodiversity and extinction patterns, arguing for the necessity of responding immediately to this crisis. He has also developed mathematical models of infectious disease that are now used by governments and NGOs to tackle diseases like AIDS.",

Compared with the existing sliding-mode controllers, the noteworthy contributions of two finite-time controllers in the proposed CNTSMC-ISS framework are the alleviation of the chattering phenomenon, the fast finite-time stability, and the singularity-free and ease-of-implementation characteristics. In the proposed CNTSMC-ISS framework, we first introduce a nonsingular integral terminal sliding-mode surface (NITSMS) such that the finite-time convergence of the system states to zero in the sliding phase is ensured and the singularity problem is avoided. Besides, a finite-time observer is developed to recover the external disturbance. Then, based on the constructed NITSMS with the supertwisting-like algorithm, the state feedback CNTSMC-ISS and the disturbance-observer-based CNTSMC-ISS are proposed, which generate the continuous control signals and guarantee the fast finite-time convergence of the system states to the designed sliding surface. Rigorous finite-time stability of the closed-loop system under two proposed controllers is provided. Finally, we apply two finite-time controllers in the proposed CNTSMC-ISS framework to the attitude control for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles under external disturbances. Extensive simulation and experimental results are illustrated to prove the effectiveness of the proposed attitude controllers.",

The proposed controller consists of two control loops: input voltage control loop oriented by MPPT algorithm to calculate the inductor current; and current control loop to calculate the duty cycle of the frequency switch. Experimental results using a solar kit are presented to verify its performance and results are compared with lead-lag and SM plus proportional\u2013integral (SMPI) controllers showing a reduction of steady-state error, overshoot, and settling time.",

            "abstract": "This article proposes a continuous nonsingular terminal sliding-mode control with integral-type sliding surface (CNTSMC-ISS) framework for disturbed systems, in which we consider two types of finite-time controllers: the state feedback CNTSMC-ISS and the disturbance-observer-based CNTSMC-ISS. Compared with the existing sliding-mode controllers, the noteworthy contributions of two finite-time controllers in the proposed CNTSMC-ISS framework are the alleviation of the chattering phenomenon, the fast finite-time stability, and the singularity-free and ease-of-implementation characteristics. In the proposed CNTSMC-ISS framework, we first introduce a nonsingular integral terminal sliding-mode surface (NITSMS) such that the finite-time convergence of the system states to zero in the sliding phase is ensured and the singularity problem is avoided. Besides, a finite-time observer is developed to recover the external disturbance. Then, based on the constructed NITSMS with the supertwisting-like algorithm, the state feedback CNTSMC-ISS and the disturbance-observer-based CNTSMC-ISS are proposed, which generate the continuous control signals and guarantee the fast finite-time convergence of the system states to the designed sliding surface. Rigorous finite-time stability of the closed-loop system under two proposed controllers is provided. Finally, we apply two finite-time controllers in the proposed CNTSMC-ISS framework to the attitude control for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles under external disturbances. Extensive simulation and experimental results are illustrated to prove the effectiveness of the proposed attitude controllers.",

By determining the coordinates of the Rip elements' centers of gravity, the system's total kinetic and potential energies were determined. The kinetic and potential energy expressions were used to generate the Lagrangian function. Expressions providing the system's equations of motion were discovered by taking the Lagrangian approach into consideration. The motor's equations, which will initiate the system, have also been considered. Through the use of state variables and a Matlab program, the system's pendulum angle was managed by using a moving sliding surface and the traditional sliding mode control technique. Based on the dynamics, the slip surface's slope was computed. The sliding surface's slope was computed based on the system's dynamics. The genetic algorithm was utilized to determine the ideal values for the coefficients employed in the control structure. The findings showed that the inaccuracy was roughly zero and that the pendulum angle took around 1.5 seconds to reach the intended reference value. Furthermore, it noted that the motor torque and current values are 12 Nm and 2.5 amps, respectively. The findings show that the motor values are reasonably similar to the values seen in real-world applications. Control in real-time applications won't be an issue if the motor is chosen based on these values",

First, a terminal integral sliding variable is designed. Based on the finite\u2010time concept, an adaptive control law has been developed in which a switching gain is adjusted adaptively by using a novel strategy. This control method aims to deal with unknown bounded disturbances and uncertainties. Moreover, it allows fast convergence of the system states to an equilibrium point. The main features of the proposed ATISMC are its robustness, fast convergence rate, and chattering avoidance. To realize trajectory tracking for WMR, the ATISMC is incorporated into a double closed loop scheme. Stability analysis is performed using the Lyapunov stability theory. Numerical simulations and real\u2010time experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed controller scheme. A comparison study with the classical ISMC was performed to show the superiority of the developed method.",

Firstly, a linear gain term is introduced into the conventional algorithm to improve discrimination accuracy of the system. Secondly, for the complexity and constraints of the gain parameters in the sliding mode algorithm, this paper designs a voltage-based time-varying function instead of multiple gains in the model, and demonstrate the stability of the proposed finite-time observer algorithm through Liapunov stability theorem. Finally, simulations and experiments were conducted on the proposed algorithm, demonstrating that the finite time super twist sliding mode control algorithm proposed in this paper can effectively reduce the impact of load changes on the output voltage.",

First, a linear gain term is introduced into the conventional super-twisting sliding mode observer model as a way of improving the identification accuracy of the observer. Then, for the multi-parameter variable problem in the traditional observer model, a rotational speed variable function design is presented, which simplifies the multi-variables into a single adaptive variable. This reduces the complexity of the observer model while further improving the observation accuracy and stability of the improved observer algorithm (which is verified using Lyapunov\u2019s stability theory). A new back EMF filter and an adaptive phase-locked loop are then used to improve the model\u2019s speed tracking capability. Finally, through simulation and experimental tests, the improved algorithm\u2019s ability to quickly observe changes in rotor position and speed, as well as its fast convergence, small jitter and high accuracy characteristics, are verified.",

            "abstract": "Existing adaptive robot control laws typically require an engineering choice of a constant adaptation gain matrix, which often involves repeated and time-consuming trial and error. Moreover, physical consistency of the estimated inertial parameters or the uniform positive definiteness of the estimated robot mass matrix cannot in general be guaranteed without nonsmooth corrections, e.g., projection to the boundary of the feasible parameter set. In this paper we present a natural adaptive control law that mitigates many of these difficulties, by exploiting the coordinate-invariant differential geometric structure of the space of physically consistent inertial parameters. Our approach provides a more generalizable and physically consistent adaptation law for the robot parameters without significant additional computations compared to existing methods. Simulation results showing markedly improved tracking error convergence over existing adaptive control laws are provided as validation.",

The proposed method employs a variable-equivalent-parameter MTPA control law to calculate the MTPA current references. Different from conventional MTPA control laws, this novel MTPA control law equivalently considers both the influence of the motor parameter values as well as the influence of the derivatives of motor parameters with respect to d- and q-axis currents on the MTPA control. Therefore, the proposed method can achieve the accurate MTPA control under different load conditions. In addition, this novel MTPA control law avoids the computation of derivatives of motor parameters and the complicated computations that exist in conventional MTPA control laws. Thus, the proposed method can provide the MTPA current references easily and in real time, allowing for fast MTPA control to be achieved. Both simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed MTPA method.",

Specifically, a dynamic model of PMLSM with lumped uncertainty is established by considering the tracking task involving parameter variations, disturbance load, etc. Then, based on the dynamic model, a FBLFTSM control law is designed to guarantee higher tracking accuracy of the surface motion than the classical terminal sliding mode control even if the system suffers from unknown disturbance. Meanwhile, the fractional-order boundary layer control has the feature of \u201clarge error turns into large gain, small error turns into small gain,\u201d which solves the contradiction between weak chattering and fast convergence in the integer-order boundary layer control and improves the dynamic performance of the system. Finally, the effectiveness of the control approach is verified by conducting tracking experiments on the cSPACE-based motor platform.",

The proposed strategy is validated by simulation using matlab simulation software, and the simulation results prove that the proposed strategy can achieve grid current and grid voltage in the same frequency and phase, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.",
