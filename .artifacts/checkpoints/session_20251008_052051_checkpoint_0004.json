To handle large non-linearities directly, sliding mode controller based\non PID-type sliding surface has been designed in this work, where Integral term\nensures fast finite convergence time. The controller parameter for various\nmodified structures can be estimated using Modified PSO, which is used as an\noffline optimization technique. Various reaching law were implemented leading\nto the proposed improved exponential power rate reaching law, which also\nimproves the finite convergence time. To implement the proposed algorithm,\nnonlinear mathematical model has to be decrypted without linearizing, and used\nfor the simulation purposes. Their performance is studied using simulations to\nprove the proposed behavior. The problem of chattering has been overcome by\nusing boundary method and also second order sliding mode method. PI-type\nsliding surface based second order sliding mode controller with PD surface\nbased SMC compensation is also proposed and implemented. The proposed\nalgorithms have been analyzed using Lyapunov stability criteria. The robustness\nof the method is provided using simulation results including disturbance and\n10% variation in system parameters. Finally process control based hardware is\nimplemented (conical tank system).",

The attitude of the sail is adjusted to ensure optimal thrust along the target course. An adaptive finite-time backstepping integral sliding mode control based on the inverse system method (ABISMC-ISM) is presented for attitude tracking of the sail. Considering the nonlinear dynamics and strong coupling of the system, a decoupling strategy is established using the inverse system method (ISM). Constructing inverse dynamics to eliminate internal coupling, the system is transformed into independent pseudolinear subsystems. For the decoupled open-loop subsystems, an adaptive finite-time backstepping integral sliding mode control is designed to achieve closed-loop control. A backstepping-based integral sliding surface is proposed to eliminate the phase-reaching stage of the sliding surface. Considering the unmodelled dynamics and external disturbances, an adaptive extreme learning machine (AELM) was designed to estimate the disturbances. Furthermore, a sliding mode reaching law based on finite-time theory was employed to ensure that the system returns to the sliding surface in a finite time under chattering conditions. Experiments on a principle prototype demonstrate the effectiveness and energy-saving performance of the proposed method.",

While dc MG can generally achieve safe, efficient, and reliable operation of the system, constant power loads (CPLs), unknown resistive loads, dc source voltage variations, and disturbance inputs might degrade the overall stability and performance if they are not compensated in the control design procedure. In this article, a fast-reaching condition-based sliding mode control (SMC) is proposed for the dc MG. The fast-reaching law contains two terms that improve the transient performance by forcing the system states to reach a sliding surface with two different rates. This attribute enhances the speed of convergence of the states to the sliding surface compared to conventional SMC. Additionally, the suggested method is resilient to system parameter uncertainties, which is indispensable in practice. The proposed controller is implemented to a dc MG that is supplied by an uncertain dc source and feeds CPLs and resistive load with time-varying power and resistance. OPAL RT results illustrate the robustness and fast convergence of the planned SMC controller.",

A practical quantum system is often exposed to uncertainties and disturbances in external fields and system Hamiltonian. Sliding mode control is a powerful tool in designing robust control for classical systems to mitigate the effect of disturbances. This paper leverages the sliding mode control technique to design a finite-time reaching law for two-level quantum systems in the presence of uncertainties in the system Hamiltonian. A numerical example is presented to showcase the effectiveness of the theoretical results. This research contributes to advancing the robust control techniques for quantum systems, paving the way for enhanced stability in quantum computing and quantum information processing applications.",

            "abstract": "This paper develops a novel fault-tolerant control based on an observer for underactuated robot manipulators with unknown external disturbances, uncertainties, and actuator faults. First, unlike the traditional approach of treating the robot system as a parameter time-varying system, the underactuated robot manipulator with different drive modes can be considered as one of the classical Markov jump nonlinear systems (MJNSs). Second, an adaptive disturbance observer is designed to estimate the state and disturbances of the system. Finally, based on the observation results, a nonsingular fast integral terminal sliding mode controller (NFITSMC) is utilized to implement fault-tolerant control of the system. Compared with traditional observer and terminal sliding mode controller, the adoption of the novel controller and observer can improve response time and reduce chattering. Especially, in order to eliminate chattering, the integral term is introduced into the nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode controller. Structuring Lyapunov\u2013Krasovskii functional (LKF) and based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) techniques, the convergence of control strategy and tracking errors is proved. The simulation results show that the actuator faults can be observed successfully and the error system is finite-time stable.",

Due to the existence of both dead-zone and saturation nonlinearities, the design process is more complicated; therefore, to solve the design complexities, the designing process is divided into two phases. The proposed method leads to output tracking with acceptable accuracy. Moreover, all signals in the closed-loop system are ultimately bounded. Simulation results illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method by its application on two practical sandwich systems (robotic system and electrohydraulic servo press system).",

A novel kind of adaptive discontinuous TVF-containment tracking protocol for linear MAS is proposed. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is shown that under the appropriate assumptions the leaders can achieve an expected TVF and track the trajectory of the tracking leader, while the follower agents can move into the convex hull formed by leader agents. Furthermore, the continuous protocols are also presented to avoid undesirable chattering from the tracking leader\u2019s nonzero input, under which the errors are uniformly ultimately bounded and the upper bound of errors can be made arbitrarily small. In the end, simulation example verifies the feasibility of the desired theoretical results.",
