\# Citation Request: PSO-Optimized Gains for Global Asymptotic Stability I need academic citations for the following theorem connecting PSO optimization to control system stability. ## THEOREM STATEMENT "The PSO-optimized gains ensure global asymptotic stability of the double inverted pendulum (DIP) system." ## TECHNICAL CONTEXT \*\*Domain:\*\* Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for controller gain tuning in underactuated mechanical systems \*\*System Description:\*\* - Double Inverted Pendulum (DIP): Two-link underactuated system with cart, highly nonlinear dynamics - Controller gains: Parameters for sliding mode control (SMC) or PID controllers - PSO optimization: Metaheuristic algorithm that searches gain space to minimize control objectives \*\*Mathematical Foundation:\*\* - Global asymptotic stability: System state converges to equilibrium from any initial condition as t → ∞ - Lyapunov stability theory: Existence of Lyapunov function V(x) with V̇(x) < 0 guarantees stability - Optimization objective: PSO minimizes fitness function (e.g., settling time, overshoot, energy) while maintaining stability \*\*Key Claim:\*\* The theorem asserts that PSO-found gains don't just optimize performance metrics, but also guarantee theoretical stability properties. This connects metaheuristic optimization to rigorous stability theory. ## REQUIRED CITATIONS Find 2-3 academic papers that: 1. \*\*Demonstrate PSO for controller tuning\*\* with proven stability guarantees (not just simulation results) 2. \*\*Establish mathematical connection\*\* between PSO-optimized parameters and Lyapunov stability 3. \*\*Apply PSO to underactuated systems\*\* (inverted pendulum, cart-pole, crane, acrobot) with stability analysis \*\*Prefer papers that:\*\* - Explicitly prove stability (not just show simulation convergence) - Use Lyapunov methods to validate PSO-tuned controllers - Address nonlinear/underactuated systems like inverted pendulums ## OUTPUT FORMAT For each citation provide: 1. \*\*Full Citation:\*\* Authors, "Title," Venue, Year, Pages 2. \*\*DOI or URL:\*\* Direct link 3. \*\*Relevance:\*\* Explain how this paper connects PSO optimization to stability guarantees 4. \*\*Key Theorem/Result:\*\* Specific stability proof or theorem that validates PSO-tuned gains ## FOCUS AREAS Seminal works in: - PSO for PID/SMC/nonlinear controller tuning - Stability analysis of optimized control systems - Inverted pendulum control with metaheuristic optimization - Lyapunov-based validation of heuristic optimization results \*\*Avoid:\*\* Papers that only show PSO works in simulation without stability proofs. Provide citations that rigorously support the claim that PSO-optimized gains ensure global asymptotic stability.

*   **PSO‑tuned gains:** While stability is established analytically, the controller gains ( $k_i$ ,  $\eta_i$ , PID coefficients, etc.) significantly affect performance. Each paper uses PSO to find gains that minimize a performance index (settling time, overshoot, energy) subject to the Lyapunov‑derived stability constraints. PSO searches the high‑dimensional gain space effectively and yields optimized gains that respect the derived inequalities[ripublication.com](https://www.ripublication.com/ijaer18/ijaerv13n14_24.pdf#:~:text=response%20in%20terms%20of%20rejection,SMC%20control%20strategies%20and%20the)[pdfs.semanticscholar.org](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8cba/7b50c35455f75b73e4ca537719d7a7857782.pdf#:~:text=Figure%201,sliding%20surfaces).
    
*   **Applicability to under‑actuated systems:** The rotary inverted pendulum and the single inverted pendulum are canonical under‑actuated systems. The hierarchical sliding‑mode framework used by Pham et al. extends naturally to multi‑link configurations such as the double inverted pendulum, because each link’s dynamics can be regulated via nested sliding surfaces.
