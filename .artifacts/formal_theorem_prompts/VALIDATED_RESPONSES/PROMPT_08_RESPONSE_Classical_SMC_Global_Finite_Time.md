Classical sliding‑mode control (SMC) – global finite‑time convergence
=====================================================================

Model and SMC law
-----------------

Consider an uncertain nonlinear SISO system

$$
\dot{x}=f(x,t)+b(x,t)\,u+d(x,t)
$$

where  $f$  and  $b$  are known nominal dynamics and input gain ( $b(x,t)>0$ ),  $d(x,t)$  is an unknown _matched_ disturbance, and  $|d(x,t)|\leq\rho$  for some known bound  $\rho>0$ . A sliding surface  $s(x,t)=0$  is defined (for example, using a weighted combination of tracking errors). The classical SMC law adds a discontinuous term to the equivalent control:

 $$
\boxed{\,u=u_{\rm eq}-\eta\operatorname{sgn}(s),\quad \eta>\rho\,}
$$

where  $u_{\rm eq}=-[\partial s/\partial x\,f(x,t)+\partial s/\partial t]\,/\,[b(x,t)\,\partial s/\partial x]$  keeps  $\dot{s}=0$  in the nominal case and  $\eta$  is the switching gain. The condition  $\eta>\rho$  (or  $\eta \geq \rho/(1-\kappa_0)+\beta_0$  in the notation of Khalil) is used to dominate the disturbance. Theorem statements and proofs in the references below show that this control guarantees that the sliding variable  $s$  reaches zero in finite time and remains there, after which the reduced‑order dynamics on the sliding surface provide exponential convergence to the desired state. The convergence is **global** because it holds for any initial state when the relevant assumptions (e.g., globally bounded  $f$ , radially unbounded Lyapunov function) are satisfied.

Explanation of the theorem with respect to the references
---------------------------------------------------------

1.  **Finite‑time reaching condition.** For the SMC law  $u=u_{\rm eq}-\eta\,\operatorname{sgn}(s)$ , the sliding variable dynamics become  $\dot{s}=-b(x,t)\,\eta\operatorname{sgn}(s)+d(x,t)$ . If the disturbance is bounded ( $|d(x,t)|\leq\rho$ ) and the input gain is positive, choosing  $\eta>\rho/b_{\min}$  yields the inequality  $s\dot{s}\leq -(b\,\eta-\rho)|s|<0$ . Slotine & Li show that this inequality implies that the integral of  $s$  decreases linearly in time, so the surface  $s=0$  is reached in a time less than  $|s(0)|/\eta$ [jccluque.files.wordpress.com](https://jccluque.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/cap7slotine-smc.pdf#:~:text=Finally%2C%20satisfying%20%287,O). Khalil’s lecture generalizes this result: by selecting  $\beta(x)$  larger than the uncertainty bound, one obtains  $s\dot{s}\leq -g_0\beta_0(1-\kappa_0)|s|$ [egr.msu.edu](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~khalil/NonlinearSystems/Sample/Lect_33.pdf#:~:text=s%20%CB%99s%20%3D%20sgv%20%2B,%5D%20%E2%80%93%20p.%204%2F1); hence the sliding variable reaches the boundary layer in finite time. Orlov’s scalar example further clarifies the finite‑time convergence mechanism[sc.iitb.ac.in](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/archiveTalks/2018-19/05-11-2018_Yury-Orlov.pdf#:~:text=Trivial%20SM%20Example%20Scalar%20relay,M%20%E2%88%92%E2%88%A5f%E2%88%A5%E2%88%9E).
    
2.  **Global property.** The finite‑time reaching holds for any initial state provided that the system satisfies the assumptions (e.g., the disturbance bound is global and the Lyapunov function is radially unbounded). Khalil’s Theorem 14.1 explicitly states that if the assumptions hold globally and the Lyapunov function is radially unbounded, then trajectories starting from any initial state are bounded and reach the sliding manifold in finite time[egr.msu.edu](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~khalil/NonlinearSystems/Sample/Lect_33.pdf#:~:text=Theorem%2014,unbounded%2C%20the%20foregoing%20conclusion%20holds). Slotine & Li note that even when the initial state is off the sliding surface, the surface is reached in finite time and then the tracking error converges exponentially to zero[jccluque.files.wordpress.com](https://jccluque.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/cap7slotine-smc.pdf#:~:text=Finally%2C%20satisfying%20%287,O). These results establish **global finite‑time convergence** under the condition that the switching gain exceeds the disturbance bound.
    
3.  **Switching gain condition.** In all references the key design condition is that the switching gain  $\eta$  (or  $k$ ) must exceed the bound on the matched uncertainty. Slotine & Li select  $k=F+\eta$  ( $F$  is the disturbance bound) to satisfy the sliding condition[jccluque.files.wordpress.com](https://jccluque.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/cap7slotine-smc.pdf#:~:text=We%20then%20have%3A%20s%20%3D,term%20discontinuous%20across%20the%20surface). Khalil requires  $\beta\geq \rho/(1-\kappa_0)+\beta_0$  to dominate the disturbance and guarantee  $s\dot{s}<0$ [egr.msu.edu](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~khalil/NonlinearSystems/Sample/Lect_33.pdf#:~:text=s%20%CB%99s%20%3D%20sgv%20%2B,%5D%20%E2%80%93%20p.%204%2F1). Orlov’s example shows that the relay gain  $M$  must be greater than  $\|f\|_\infty$  for finite‑time stability[sc.iitb.ac.in](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/archiveTalks/2018-19/05-11-2018_Yury-Orlov.pdf#:~:text=Trivial%20SM%20Example%20Scalar%20relay,M%20%E2%88%92%E2%88%A5f%E2%88%A5%E2%88%9E). Thus, choosing  $\eta>\rho$  is both necessary and sufficient (with a margin) to ensure finite‑time reaching and robust sliding motion.
    

Summary
-------

The classical sliding‑mode control law uses a discontinuous feedback term to force the sliding variable to reach zero in finite time despite matched disturbances. Slotine & Li’s textbook provides a detailed construction and shows that choosing the switching gain larger than the disturbance bound ensures the sliding condition and finite‑time reaching[jccluque.files.wordpress.com](https://jccluque.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/cap7slotine-smc.pdf#:~:text=We%20then%20have%3A%20s%20%3D,term%20discontinuous%20across%20the%20surface)[jccluque.files.wordpress.com](https://jccluque.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/cap7slotine-smc.pdf#:~:text=Finally%2C%20satisfying%20%287,O). Khalil’s lecture generalizes this result and offers a Lyapunov‑based proof that trajectories reach the sliding surface in finite time from any initial state when the gain exceeds the uncertainty bound[egr.msu.edu](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~khalil/NonlinearSystems/Sample/Lect_33.pdf#:~:text=s%20%CB%99s%20%3D%20sgv%20%2B,%5D%20%E2%80%93%20p.%204%2F1)[egr.msu.edu](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~khalil/NonlinearSystems/Sample/Lect_33.pdf#:~:text=Theorem%2014,unbounded%2C%20the%20foregoing%20conclusion%20holds). Orlov’s lecture notes illustrate the same phenomenon with a simple scalar relay system, demonstrating that a relay gain larger than the disturbance bound yields finite‑time convergence[sc.iitb.ac.in](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/archiveTalks/2018-19/05-11-2018_Yury-Orlov.pdf#:~:text=Trivial%20SM%20Example%20Scalar%20relay,M%20%E2%88%92%E2%88%A5f%E2%88%A5%E2%88%9E). Collectively, these references show that for the uncertain nonlinear system considered, the classical SMC law with **switching gain  $\eta>\rho$ ** guarantees **global finite‑time convergence** to the sliding surface, followed by exponential convergence on the reduced‑order sliding dynamics.

In summary, the report explains that classical sliding-mode control (SMC) uses a discontinuous control law u = u\_eq – η·sgn(s) to force the sliding variable s to zero in finite time despite matched uncertainties bounded by ρ. It notes that choosing the switching gain η greater than the disturbance bound ensures the reaching condition s·ŝ ≤ –(b·η – ρ)|s| holds, so s hits the sliding surface in a time ≤ |s(0)|/(η·b\_min). The report underscores that once on the surface, the reduced-order dynamics lead to exponential convergence of the tracking error.

I also learned that this finite-time reachability is global when the uncertainty bounds and Lyapunov functions are defined over the entire state space. Khalil’s theorem formalizes this by showing all trajectories reach a positively invariant set in finite time given β ≥ ρ/(1 – κ0) + β0. Orlov’s examples illustrate the same concept with a scalar relay system, where a relay gain exceeding the disturbance bound yields finite-time stability. Overall, the report confirms that classical SMC achieves robust, finite-time, and global convergence by judiciously selecting the switching gain above the uncertainty bound.

Slotine & Li’s textbook provides a detailed construction and shows that choosing the switching gain larger than the disturbance bound ensures the sliding condition and finite‑time reaching[jccluque.files.wordpress.com](https://jccluque.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/cap7slotine-smc.pdf#:~:text=We%20then%20have%3A%20s%20%3D,term%20discontinuous%20across%20the%20surface)[jccluque.files.wordpress.com](https://jccluque.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/cap7slotine-smc.pdf#:~:text=Finally%2C%20satisfying%20%287,O). Khalil’s lecture generalizes this result and offers a Lyapunov‑based proof that trajectories reach the sliding surface in finite time from any initial state when the gain exceeds the uncertainty bound[egr.msu.edu](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~khalil/NonlinearSystems/Sample/Lect_33.pdf#:~:text=s%20%CB%99s%20%3D%20sgv%20%2B,%5D%20%E2%80%93%20p.%204%2F1)[egr.msu.edu](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~khalil/NonlinearSystems/Sample/Lect_33.pdf#:~:text=Theorem%2014,unbounded%2C%20the%20foregoing%20conclusion%20holds). Orlov’s lecture notes illustrate the same phenomenon with a simple scalar relay system, demonstrating that a relay gain larger than the disturbance bound yields finite‑time convergence[sc.iitb.ac.in](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/archiveTalks/2018-19/05-11-2018_Yury-Orlov.pdf#:~:text=Trivial%20SM%20Example%20Scalar%20relay,M%20%E2%88%92%E2%88%A5f%E2%88%A5%E2%88%9E). Collectively, these references show that for the uncertain nonlinear system considered, the classical SMC law with **switching gain  $\eta>\rho$ ** guarantees **global finite‑time convergence** to the sliding surface, followed by exponential convergence on the reduced‑order sliding dynamics.

In summary, the report explains that classical sliding-mode control (SMC) uses a discontinuous control law u = u\_eq – η·sgn(s) to force the sliding variable s to zero in finite time despite matched uncertainties bounded by ρ. It notes that choosing the switching gain η greater than the disturbance bound ensures the reaching condition s·ŝ ≤ –(b·η – ρ)|s| holds, so s hits the sliding surface in a time ≤ |s(0)|/(η·b\_min). The report underscores that once on the surface, the reduced-order dynamics lead to exponential convergence of the tracking error.

I also learned that this finite-time reachability is global when the uncertainty bounds and Lyapunov functions are defined over the entire state space. Khalil’s theorem formalizes this by showing all trajectories reach a positively invariant set in finite time given β ≥ ρ/(1 – κ0) + β0. Orlov’s examples illustrate the same concept with a scalar relay system, where a relay gain exceeding the disturbance bound yields finite-time stability. Overall, the report confirms that classical SMC achieves robust, finite-time, and global convergence by judiciously selecting the switching gain above the uncertainty bound.
