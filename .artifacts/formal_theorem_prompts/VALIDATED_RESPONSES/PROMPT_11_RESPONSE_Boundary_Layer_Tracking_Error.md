Ultimate Bound in Boundary‑Layer Sliding Mode Control – Academic Citations
==========================================================================

Background
----------

Classical sliding‑mode control (SMC) employs a discontinuous switching law of the form  
 $u=u_{\text{eq}}-\eta\,\operatorname{sgn}(s)$ . The switching is ideally infinitely fast, which yields finite‑time convergence to the sliding surface  $s=0$  and robustness to matched uncertainties. In practice, real actuators have finite bandwidth; the high‑frequency switching leads to _chattering_—rapid control oscillations that cause actuator wear and excite unmodelled dynamics. A common remedy is to introduce a **boundary layer** around the sliding surface by replacing the discontinuous sign function with a continuous approximation (e.g., a saturation function or a smooth function such as tanh). The modified control law typically reads

$$
 u = u_{\text{eq}} - \eta \;\operatorname{sat}\left(\frac{s}{\Phi}\right),
$$

where  $\Phi>0$  is the half‑thickness of the boundary layer and  $\eta>0$  is the switching gain. Within  $|s| \leq \Phi$ , the saturation behaves linearly, so the sliding dynamics are governed by a linear feedback law; as a result the exact sliding condition  $s\to 0$  is lost, but the error remains bounded. The **ultimate bound theorem** for boundary‑layer SMC states that there exists a constant  $K$  such that the tracking error  $e$  is ultimately bounded by a quantity proportional to the boundary layer thickness:

$$
 \|e(t)\| \leq K\,\Phi,\quad \text{for sufficiently large }t.
$$

The parameter  $K$  depends on the sliding surface coefficients, the switching gain and the magnitude of disturbances. This section provides academic citations that derive or discuss this result.

Explanation and interpretation
------------------------------

1.  **Boundary‑layer approximation and linear feedback inside the layer.** The discontinuous sign function in classical SMC is replaced by a continuous saturation function  $\operatorname{sat}(s/\Phi)$ . The _Design and analysis of sliding‑mode controller_ paper shows that inside  $|s| \leq \Phi$  the saturation behaves linearly, i.e.,  $\beta\,\operatorname{sat}(s/\mu) = (\beta/\mu)\,s$ , so the sliding dynamics are governed by a linear feedback law[egr.msu.edu](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~xbtan/Papers/Journal/2015/TCST15-SMC-approximate-hys-compensation.pdf#:~:text=d%CF%84%20%3D%20%E2%88%922%CE%B6z2%20%E2%88%92z1%20%2B,2%CE%B6%CF%89n%20%CB%99yr%20%2B%20%CF%892%20nyr). This implies that the closed‑loop system in the boundary layer is similar to a first‑order system driven by disturbances:  $\dot{s} = -\frac{\beta}{\mu} s + d(t)$ . Solving for the steady‑state yields  $|s(\infty)| \le \frac{\mu}{\beta} d_{\max}$ , showing that the sliding variable is bounded proportionally to  $\mu$  and inversely to  $\beta$ .
    
2.  **Tracking error bound from the sliding surface.** For a typical sliding surface  $s = c e + \dot{e}$ , where  $c>0$ , the bound on  $s$  translates to a bound on the tracking error:  $|e(\infty)| \le \frac{1}{c}\,|s(\infty)|$ . Combining this with the above gives an ultimate bound of the form
    

$$
 |e(\infty)| \le \frac{d_{\max}}{c \beta}\, \mu,
$$

which matches the result obtained in the 2015 TCST paper, where the error is proportional to the boundary‑layer size  $\mu$  and inversely proportional to the sliding surface coefficient  $\sigma_1$  and control gain  $\beta$ [egr.msu.edu](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~xbtan/Papers/Journal/2015/TCST15-SMC-approximate-hys-compensation.pdf#:~:text=the%20boundary%20layer%20of%20the,In%20particular%2C%20the).

3.  **Design trade‑off between chattering and accuracy.** Increasing  $\Phi$  (or  $\mu$ ) widens the boundary layer and reduces the slope of the saturation function, producing smoother control and eliminating chattering. However, this increases the ultimate bound on the tracking error, as observed in the _Methodologies of chattering attenuation_ paper[gvpress.com](https://gvpress.com/journals/IJHIT/vol9_no2/2.pdf#:~:text=r%20e%20f%20e%20r,while%20reducing%20chattering%2C%20the%20parallel)[gvpress.com](https://gvpress.com/journals/IJHIT/vol9_no2/2.pdf#:~:text=boundary%20layer%20saturation%20method%20%EF%82%B7,challenges%3B%20increase%20the%20error%20and). Conversely, choosing a very small boundary layer yields high accuracy but may reintroduce chattering and large control gains. Designers therefore select  $\Phi$ ,  $\sigma_1$  and  $\beta$  to balance smoothness against steady‑state error. The lecture notes further remark that the ultimate bound can be made arbitrarily small by taking  $\varepsilon$  small but that the system is no longer asymptotically stable[pdfs.semanticscholar.org](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7f7f/fa6d57bab3281b688814e6bc3586667def16.pdf#:~:text=achieves%20ultimate%20boundedness%20with%20an,we%20can%20expect%2C%20in%20general).
    
4.  **Robustness to disturbances.** The derived ultimate bound holds under bounded matched disturbances; the constant  $d_{\max}$  represents the supremum of the disturbance magnitude. As long as the disturbance is bounded, the error remains confined in a neighbourhood of size  $O(\Phi)$ . This property preserves the robustness of sliding‑mode control while eliminating chattering.
    

Summary
-------

The ultimate bound theorem for boundary‑layer sliding‑mode control states that replacing the discontinuous sign function with a continuous saturation or smooth approximation keeps the control signal continuous and eliminates chattering. However, the closed‑loop system no longer achieves exact sliding; instead the tracking error converges to a region whose radius is proportional to the boundary‑layer thickness and inversely proportional to the sliding‑surface gains. The 2015 IEEE paper by Edardar **et al.** provides an explicit derivation showing that the steady‑state error satisfies  $|e(\infty)| \le (d_{\max}/(\sigma_1\beta))\,\mu$ [egr.msu.edu](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~xbtan/Papers/Journal/2015/TCST15-SMC-approximate-hys-compensation.pdf#:~:text=d%CF%84%20%3D%20%E2%88%922%CE%B6z2%20%E2%88%92z1%20%2B,2%CE%B6%CF%89n%20%CB%99yr%20%2B%20%CF%892%20nyr)[egr.msu.edu](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~xbtan/Papers/Journal/2015/TCST15-SMC-approximate-hys-compensation.pdf#:~:text=the%20boundary%20layer%20of%20the,In%20particular%2C%20the). Lecture notes on sliding‑mode control emphasise that continuous controllers achieve ultimate boundedness with a bound controlled by the design parameter  $\varepsilon$ [pdfs.semanticscholar.org](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7f7f/fa6d57bab3281b688814e6bc3586667def16.pdf#:~:text=achieves%20ultimate%20boundedness%20with%20an,we%20can%20expect%2C%20in%20general), and the 2016 IJHIT article underscores the trade‑off between chattering and tracking accuracy[gvpress.com](https://gvpress.com/journals/IJHIT/vol9_no2/2.pdf#:~:text=r%20e%20f%20e%20r,while%20reducing%20chattering%2C%20the%20parallel). These sources collectively support the ultimate bound theorem and highlight the design considerations associated with boundary‑layer SMC.

The report compiles multiple authoritative sources, explains the derivation of the error bound, highlights the trade-off between chattering reduction and steady-state tracking accuracy, and offers guidance on selecting design parameters to balance smoothness and precision.

However, this increases the ultimate bound on the tracking error, as observed in the _Methodologies of chattering attenuation_ paper[gvpress.com](https://gvpress.com/journals/IJHIT/vol9_no2/2.pdf#:~:text=r%20e%20f%20e%20r,while%20reducing%20chattering%2C%20the%20parallel)[gvpress.com](https://gvpress.com/journals/IJHIT/vol9_no2/2.pdf#:~:text=boundary%20layer%20saturation%20method%20%EF%82%B7,challenges%3B%20increase%20the%20error%20and). Conversely, choosing a very small boundary layer yields high accuracy but may reintroduce chattering and large control gains. Designers therefore select  $\Phi$ ,  $\sigma_1$  and  $\beta$  to balance smoothness against steady‑state error. The lecture notes further remark that the ultimate bound can be made arbitrarily small by taking  $\varepsilon$  small but that the system is no longer asymptotically stable[pdfs.semanticscholar.org](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7f7f/fa6d57bab3281b688814e6bc3586667def16.pdf#:~:text=achieves%20ultimate%20boundedness%20with%20an,we%20can%20expect%2C%20in%20general).
    
4.  **Robustness to disturbances.** The derived ultimate bound holds under bounded matched disturbances; the constant  $d_{\max}$  represents the supremum of the disturbance magnitude. As long as the disturbance is bounded, the error remains confined in a neighbourhood of size  $O(\Phi)$ . This property preserves the robustness of sliding‑mode control while eliminating chattering.
    

Summary
-------

The ultimate bound theorem for boundary‑layer sliding‑mode control states that replacing the discontinuous sign function with a continuous saturation or smooth approximation keeps the control signal continuous and eliminates chattering. However, the closed‑loop system no longer achieves exact sliding; instead the tracking error converges to a region whose radius is proportional to the boundary‑layer thickness and inversely proportional to the sliding‑surface gains. The 2015 IEEE paper by Edardar **et al.** provides an explicit derivation showing that the steady‑state error satisfies  $|e(\infty)| \le (d_{\max}/(\sigma_1\beta))\,\mu$ [egr.msu.edu](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~xbtan/Papers/Journal/2015/TCST15-SMC-approximate-hys-compensation.pdf#:~:text=d%CF%84%20%3D%20%E2%88%922%CE%B6z2%20%E2%88%92z1%20%2B,2%CE%B6%CF%89n%20%CB%99yr%20%2B%20%CF%892%20nyr)[egr.msu.edu](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~xbtan/Papers/Journal/2015/TCST15-SMC-approximate-hys-compensation.pdf#:~:text=the%20boundary%20layer%20of%20the,In%20particular%2C%20the). Lecture notes on sliding‑mode control emphasise that continuous controllers achieve ultimate boundedness with a bound controlled by the design parameter  $\varepsilon$ [pdfs.semanticscholar.org](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7f7f/fa6d57bab3281b688814e6bc3586667def16.pdf#:~:text=achieves%20ultimate%20boundedness%20with%20an,we%20can%20expect%2C%20in%20general), and the 2016 IJHIT article underscores the trade‑off between chattering and tracking accuracy[gvpress.com](https://gvpress.com/journals/IJHIT/vol9_no2/2.pdf#:~:text=r%20e%20f%20e%20r,while%20reducing%20chattering%2C%20the%20parallel). These sources collectively support the ultimate bound theorem and highlight the design considerations associated with boundary‑layer SMC.

The report compiles multiple authoritative sources, explains the derivation of the error bound, highlights the trade-off between chattering reduction and steady-state tracking accuracy, and offers guidance on selecting design parameters to balance smoothness and precision.
