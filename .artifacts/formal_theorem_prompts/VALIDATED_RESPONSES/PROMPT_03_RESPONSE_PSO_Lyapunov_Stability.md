Understood. I will search for recent academic papers that specifically address the intersection of Lyapunov stability theory and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for tuning controller gains in closed-loop systems like the double inverted pendulum. I'll ensure each citation I provide includes a complete reference, direct link, relevance explanation, and the particular theorem or mathematical formulation related to maintaining Lyapunov stability under PSO tuning. I'll gather two to three authoritative sources and share them with you once I've completed the research.

Here are academic sources that explicitly prove Lyapunov stability for closed‑loop systems whose controller gains are tuned by particle‑swarm optimisation (PSO). Each source derives a Lyapunov function, shows that its derivative is non‑positive under the chosen control law, and then uses PSO to optimise controller parameters without violating this stability condition. These results support the theorem that PSO‑optimised gains preserve (rather than destroy) Lyapunov stability in double‑inverted‑pendulum and similar under‑actuated systems.

**Summary**

Each cited paper explicitly uses Lyapunov functions to derive controllers whose stability is independent of the specific gain values. The PSO algorithms in these studies are employed to tune the controller gains within ranges that satisfy the Lyapunov conditions. Consequently, the optimised gains obtained via PSO or its variants (HEPSO, HSMC‑PSO or MPSO) do **not** alter the negative‑definite derivative of the Lyapunov function. These results support the theorem that PSO‑optimised gains maintain Lyapunov stability for closed‑loop systems such as the double inverted pendulum.
