## Likely Citations (Pre-Research Suggestions)

Based on the topic **Numerical Methods**, you will likely find references to:

- Press et al. (2007) 'Numerical Recipes' (3rd ed.)
- Dormand & Prince (1980) 'A family of embedded Runge-Kutta formulae'
- Shampine & Reichelt (1997) 'The MATLAB ODE Suite'


**Research Strategy:**
1. Start with these classic references
2. Check if they cover the specific techniques in your claims
3. If not, search for more specific papers (ChatGPT will help!)
