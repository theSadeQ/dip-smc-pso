I need academic citations for pso optimization claims in a control systems research project (Double Inverted Pendulum with Sliding Mode Control and PSO Optimization).

**Context:** These claims describe pso optimization implementations and theoretical foundations. I need authoritative citations to support each claim.

**Output Format Required:**
For EACH claim below, provide EXACTLY this format:

```
CLAIM X (ID: [claim_id]):
- Citation: Author (Year)
- BibTeX Key: firstauthor_year_keyword
- DOI: [DOI or "N/A" if book/unavailable]
- Type: journal/conference/book/arxiv
- Note: [1-2 sentences explaining why this citation fits this specific claim]
```

**Claims to Research:**


CLAIM 1 (ID: FORMAL-THEOREM-004):
- Description: "The PSO-optimized gains ensure global asymptotic stability of the DIP system."
- Context: "The PSO-optimized gains ensure global asymptotic stability of the DIP system."

- Line: 733
- Current Status: N/A
- Keywords: ['The', 'PSO-optimized', 'gains', 'ensure', 'global']


CLAIM 2 (ID: FORMAL-THEOREM-005):
- Description: "The PSO-optimized gains maintain Lyapunov stability for the closed-loop DIP system."
- Context: "The PSO-optimized gains maintain Lyapunov stability for the closed-loop DIP system."
- File: docs/pso_integration_technical_specification.md
- Line: 875
- Current Status: N/A
- Keywords: ['The', 'PSO-optimized', 'gains', 'maintain', 'Lyapunov']


CLAIM 3 (ID: FORMAL-THEOREM-010):
- Description: "Under the stability condition and with decreasing inertia weight, PSO converges to the global optimum with probability 1 for unimodal functions."
- Context: "Under the stability condition and with decreasing inertia weight, PSO converges to the global optimum with probability 1 for unimodal functions."
- File: docs/theory/pso_optimization_complete.md
- Line: 115
- Current Status: N/A
- Keywords: ['Under', 'the', 'stability', 'condition', 'and']



**Suggested Starting References:**
- Kennedy & Eberhart (1995) 'Particle swarm optimization'
- Shi & Eberhart (1998) 'A modified particle swarm optimizer'
- Clerc & Kennedy (2002) 'The particle swarm - explosion, stability, and convergence'


**Important Guidelines:**
1. **Prioritize authoritative sources:**
   - Top-tier journals: IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, Automatica, Control Engineering Practice
   - Seminal textbooks: Slotine & Li, Khalil, Utkin, etc.
   - Landmark conference papers: CDC, ACC, IFAC

2. **For theorems/lemmas:** Cite the ORIGINAL paper where the theorem was first proven, not surveys or textbooks (unless the textbook is the original source)

3. **For implementations:** Cite the source that best describes the specific technique used (e.g., boundary layer â†’ Slotine & Li Ch. 7)

4. **If uncertain:** Suggest 2-3 alternative citations and note why each might be appropriate

5. **BibTeX keys:** Use format `firstauthor_year_keyword` (e.g., `slotine1991applied`, `levant2003higher`)
