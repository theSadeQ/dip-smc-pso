- Note: In his seminal IEEE Transactions paper on variable‑structure systems, Utkin develops the classical sliding‑mode control (SMC) law for systems with matched uncertainties. The paper shows that if the switching gain η is chosen to exceed the bound ρ of the disturbance, the reaching condition (\dot{s} = -\eta,\mathrm{sign}(s)) implies (s,\dot{s} = -\eta |s|). This inequality guarantees that the sliding variable (s) decreases monotonically and reaches zero in a finite time for any initial condition, i.e., the state converges globally to the sliding surface. Thus, Utkin's result provides the theoretical foundation for the claim that a classical SMC law with switching gain greater than the uncertainty bound ensures global finite‑time convergence to the sliding surface.

CLAIM 2 (ID: FORMAL-THEOREM-021):

- Citation: Moreno & Osorio (2012)

- Type: journal
- Note: Moreno and Osorio's IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control article presents strict Lyapunov functions for the super‑twisting algorithm—an important second‑order sliding‑mode controller. Their Lyapunov analysis shows that appropriate choices of the super‑twisting gains make the Lyapunov derivative negative definite, yielding finite‑time convergence of both the sliding variable (s) and its derivative (\dot{s}) to zero. The paper explicitly states that the proposed Lyapunov functions "ascertain finite time convergence" for the super‑twisting algorithm, supporting the claim that the algorithm drives the system to the second‑order sliding set ({s=0,\dot{s}=0}) in finite time when parameter conditions are satisfied.
