---

#### Session 12-14 (8-10 hours): Persian Translation
**Goal**: Translate entire thesis to Persian for bilingual submission

**Approach**:
1. Use `thesis_persian.tex` template (already set up with XePersian)
2. Translate chapter-by-chapter (Chapters 1-9)
3. Maintain technical terminology consistency (create glossary if needed)
4. Compile Persian version to verify right-to-left rendering

**Note**: This is typically required for Iranian universities. Check with your supervisor whether full translation is mandatory or if English-only is acceptable.

- Slides 2-3: Problem and motivation
- Slides 4-5: Methodology (SMC + PSO)
- Slides 6-8: Results (MT-6 success, MT-7/MT-8 failures)
- Slides 9-10: Conclusions and future work
- Slides 11-12: Q&A backup slides

**Format**: Beamer LaTeX or PowerPoint

---

### **OPTION 2: Conference Paper PDF Compilation (6-8 hours)**

**Goal**: Finalize the 6-page IEEE conference paper (separate from thesis)
**Status**: LaTeX manuscript 100% complete (950 lines), needs PDF compilation + condensing
**Time**: 6-8 hours

**Tasks**:
1. **Compile PDF** (1 hour): Fix any LaTeX compilation errors, generate PDF
2. **Condense to 6 pages** (4-5 hours): Currently ~8-10 pages, need to trim
   - Reduce Section II (Literature) from 3 pages → 2 pages
   - Reduce Section III (System Modeling) from 1.5 pages → 1 page (cite full derivations in thesis)
   - Tighten Results section (VII)
3. **Create Figure 1** (1 hour): DIP schematic (currently deferred)
4. **Final proofreading** (1 hour): Grammar, equation consistency, reference formatting
5. **Submit to conference** (if applicable)

**Note**: The conference paper and thesis are **independent deliverables**. The conference paper is a condensed 6-page summary; the thesis is a comprehensive 90-page document. You can work on both in parallel or finish thesis first (recommended).

---

### **OPTION 3: Hybrid Approach (Flexible)**

**Goal**: Mix thesis chapters + conference paper finalization based on deadlines

**Scenarios**:
1. **Conference deadline soon**: Prioritize Option 2 (conference paper), then return to thesis
2. **Thesis defense deadline soon**: Prioritize Option 1 (thesis chapters), skip conference paper
3. **Both deadlines distant**: Complete thesis first (Option 1), then polish conference paper (Option 2)

**Recommendation**: If you have no immediate conference submission deadline, **focus on thesis completion (Option 1)** for these reasons:
- Thesis is your primary M.Sc. requirement
- Conference paper can be extracted from completed thesis (easier to condense complete work than expand incomplete work)
- Chapters 4-9 are already outlined in conference paper; expansion is straightforward

---

---

## How to Continue From Here

### If choosing **Option 1** (Thesis Chapters 4-9):

1. **Start Session 4 when ready** (estimated 4 hours):
   - Tell me: "Start Session 4: Chapter 4 (Controller Design)"
   - I will create Chapter 4 expanding conference paper Section IV
   - Estimated deliverable: 12 pages, ~4,200 words, 20+ equations

2. **After each session**, I will:
   - Create the chapter LaTeX file
   - Create a Session N Completion Summary
   - Update this roadmap with progress
   - Commit and push to your repository

3. **After Session 9** (Chapter 9 complete):
   - Decide whether to do Appendices (optional, adds rigor)
   - Decide whether Persian translation is required (check university requirements)
   - Compile full thesis PDF (all 9 chapters)
   - **Submit to supervisor for review**

---

### If choosing **Option 2** (Conference Paper):

1. **Start conference paper finalization**:
   - Tell me: "Finalize conference paper PDF"
   - I will compile the LaTeX, identify condensing targets, help trim to 6 pages

2. **Tasks**:
   - Fix any LaTeX compilation errors
   - Condense sections to fit 6-page limit
   - Create Figure 1 (DIP schematic) if needed
   - Proofread and submit

3. **After conference paper done**:
   - Return to thesis (Option 1) to complete Chapters 4-9

---

### If choosing **Option 3** (Hybrid):

- Let me know your deadlines, and I'll create a custom timeline mixing thesis chapters + conference paper tasks.

---

## Key Decisions You Need to Make

### Decision 1: Which option to prioritize?
- **Thesis-first (Option 1)**: Best if no conference deadline soon
- **Conference-first (Option 2)**: Best if conference submission deadline imminent
- **Hybrid (Option 3)**: Best if you want flexibility

### Decision 2: Persian translation?
- **Full translation** (8-10 hours): Required for some Iranian universities
- **English-only**: Acceptable for some programs, check requirements

### Decision 3: Appendices?
- **Include Appendices A-C** (adds 10 pages, 4-6 hours): Recommended for rigorous thesis, especially if aiming for publication
- **Skip Appendices**: Acceptable if aiming for minimal submission

### Decision 4: Defense slides?
- **Create slides** (2-3 hours): Recommended to prepare for defense presentation
- **Skip slides**: Can prepare later, closer to defense date

---

## References Status

**Current**: ~45 references (34 conference + 10 foundational from Chapter 2 + 1-2 from Chapter 3)
**Target**: 64 references (Session 1 plan)

**References to Add** (19 more):
- Chapter 3 added: 1-2 references (Lagrangian mechanics, controllability theory) — **TO BE ADDED TO references.bib**
- Chapter 4 will add: 5 references (SMC design, Lyapunov theory)
- Chapter 5 will add: 3 references (PSO algorithms, optimization theory)
- Chapter 6 will add: 2 references (simulation methods, validation standards)
- Chapter 7 will add: 3 references (performance metrics, statistical methods)
- Chapter 8 will add: 3 references (comparative studies)
- Chapter 9 will add: 2 references (future directions)

**Strategy**: Each chapter naturally adds 2-5 references. By Chapter 9, you'll reach ~64 references with no forced additions.

---

## Quality Standards (Already Met in Chapters 1-3)

✅ **LaTeX Quality**:
- Proper document class (`report`, 12pt, A4)
- Iranian standard margins (3.5cm left for binding)
- Hyperref for cross-references
- Bibliography setup (IEEEtran style)
- Equation numbering, table formatting

✅ **Content Quality**:
- Clear narrative arc (background → gap → contributions)
- Explicit research questions with hypotheses
- Quantified contributions (66.5%, 50.4×, 0%)
- Honest acknowledgment of limitations
- Proper citations

✅ **Mathematical Rigor**:
- All equations numbered and referenced
- Derivations shown step-by-step (Chapter 3 Lagrangian)
- Theorems stated and proven (Theorem 3.1 Controllability)
- Consistent notation throughout

---

## Tips for Efficient Progress

1. **Work in 2-4 hour sessions**: This matches the estimated chapter times and prevents fatigue.

2. **Review previous session before starting next**: Quickly skim the last chapter to maintain continuity.

3. **Compile thesis after every 1-2 chapters**: Catch LaTeX errors early (missing references, broken cross-references).

4. **Share Chapters 1-3 with supervisor now**: Get early feedback to guide Chapters 4-9. Better to fix structural issues now than after completing all chapters.

5. **Keep references organized**: When I cite `\cite{spong2006robot}`, immediately add the BibTeX entry to `references.bib`. Don't batch this at the end.

6. **Don't perfectionism-trap on early chapters**: Chapters 1-3 are already thesis-quality. Resist urge to endlessly revise. Move forward to Chapters 4-9, then do a final holistic revision.

7. **Use conference paper figures directly**: The 6 figures in `.artifacts/LT7_research_paper/figures/` can be directly copied to thesis `figures/` directory and referenced in Chapters 6-7.

---

## Next Immediate Steps (Your Decision)

**Tell me one of these**:

1. **"Start Session 4"** → I'll create Chapter 4 (Controller Design, 12 pages, 4 hours)
2. **"Finalize conference paper"** → I'll compile and help condense to 6 pages
3. **"Show me a custom timeline"** → Tell me your deadlines, I'll create a hybrid plan
4. **"Add the missing references to references.bib"** → I'll add the 5 references needed for Chapter 3 (mechanics, controllability theory)
5. **"Compile a partial thesis PDF"** → I'll help you compile Chapters 1-3 into a PDF for review
