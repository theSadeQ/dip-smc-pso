## 💡 Key Insights This Session

### What Went Well
1. **3× expansion strategy**: Conference paper Section II (2,000 words) → Chapter 2 (5,350 words) achieved by:
   - Adding theoretical foundations (Lyapunov proofs, PSO convergence analysis)
   - Expanding each subsection with deeper technical details
   - Creating 4 comparison tables (vs. conference paper's 1)
   - Explicit research gap synthesis (separate section)

2. **Table-driven organization**: 4 tables provide clear structure and visual comparison:
   - Table 2.1: Chattering mitigation approaches (6 techniques)
   - Table 2.2: DIP control methods (5 approaches)
   - Table 2.3: Research gaps summary (4 gaps)
   - Table 2.4: State-of-the-art comparison (9 papers)

3. **Critical analysis depth**: Each surveyed technique includes:
   - Technical description (equations, mechanisms)
   - Recent applications (2023-2025 papers)
   - Advantages (why it's used)
   - Limitations (why it's insufficient for our purpose)

4. **Positioning clarity**: Section 2.6 explicitly demonstrates novelty by:
   - Comparing with 6 recent studies (Table 2.4)
   - Listing 4 novel contributions with equations
   - Highlighting methodological distinctions

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Balancing breadth vs. depth**: Chapter 2 covers 4 major topics (SMC, chattering, PSO, DIP). Solution: Prioritize depth in areas directly relevant to thesis (adaptive boundary layers, PSO for SMC), provide concise coverage of tangential topics (MPC, feedback linearization).

2. **Avoiding redundancy with Chapter 1**: Introduction (Chapter 1) provided high-level motivation; Literature Review (Chapter 2) provides technical depth. Clear delineation maintained by:
   - Chapter 1: "What is chattering and why does it matter?" (problem statement)
   - Chapter 2: "How have researchers addressed chattering?" (solutions survey)

3. **Thesis vs. conference paper tone**: Conference papers are concise; theses are comprehensive. Achieved thesis tone by:
   - Including full derivations (Lyapunov finite-time proof)
   - Providing historical context (Utkin 1977 origins)
   - Explaining foundational concepts (variable structure systems)

### For Next Session (Chapter 3)
1. **Mathematical rigor**: Chapter 3 (System Modeling) requires full Lagrangian derivation. Unlike conference paper (which cited derivations), thesis should show all steps for pedagogical completeness.

2. **Figure integration**: Chapter 3 will benefit from DIP schematic (Figure 1 from conference paper). If not created yet, use placeholder box with caption.

3. **Notation consistency**: Ensure state-space notation ($\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{f}, \mathbf{g}$) matches Chapter 2's SMC fundamentals section.
