## üí° Lessons Learned

### What Went Exceptionally Well

1. **Systematic approach**: Writing sections in logical order (I‚ÜíII‚Üí...‚ÜíIX) maintained coherent narrative
2. **Data preparation first**: Having all results validated before writing saved time
3. **Cross-referencing**: Consistent notation and forward/backward references ensured integration
4. **Honest framing**: Reporting negative results as contributions (not weaknesses) strengthened paper
5. **Literature review**: Web search for recent papers (2023-2025) provided cutting-edge context

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Word count**: Initial draft ~18,700 words needs condensing to ~6,000 (67% reduction) ‚Üí LaTeX phase will address
2. **Balancing rigor vs. accessibility**: Included proof sketches + full proofs to serve both audiences
3. **Negative results framing**: Positioned failures as "honest reporting" contribution, not limitation
4. **Literature comparison**: Table I format made distinctions clear without being dismissive

### For Future Papers

1. **Start with outline**: Create detailed section outline with subsection headers before writing
2. **Write Results first**: Easiest section, builds momentum, clarifies contributions
3. **Literature review early**: Provides context for positioning, informs gap identification
4. **Discussion interprets, not repeats**: Link results to literature, explain mechanisms, propose solutions
5. **Conclusions concise**: Summary (1 para) + Limitations (1 para) + Future Work (1 para) = sufficient
