The authors derive the desired dynamics ( \\dot{x}_1 + c x_1 =0) and solve it to get (x_1(t)=x_1(0)e^{-ct}) and (x_2(t)=-c,x_1(0)e^{-ct}), noting that both states converge exponentially at a rate (c). They explain that driving (σ) to zero in finite time produces these exponential dynamics with convergence rates determined by the positive parameter (c).",

Integrating this inequality shows that the trajectory reaches the sliding surface in finite time bounded by (t_{\\mathrm{reach}} \\le |s(0)|/\\eta). This provides a formal bound on the time required to reach the sliding surface under the reaching condition.",

In the same chapter, Shtessel and co‑authors propose a sliding‑mode control law (u=-c,x_2-\\varphi,\\mathrm{sign}(σ)) and show that the control gain (\\varphi) must exceed the disturbance bound (L) by choosing (\\varphi = L + \\alpha\\sqrt{2}). They remark that the first term (L) compensates for the bounded uncertainty while the additional term (\\alpha\\sqrt{2}) determines the reaching time; a larger (\\alpha) yields a shorter finite‑time convergence to the sliding surface. This classical result demonstrates that choosing the switching gain greater than the uncertainty bound guarantees finite‑time convergence.",

To mitigate chattering, Slotine and Li introduce a boundary layer of thickness (\\phi) around the sliding surface and replace the discontinuous sign function with (s/\\phi) within this layer. They prove that this boundary‑layer method makes the layer attractive and ensures that the tracking error components satisfy (|x_i(t)| \\le 2\\lambda,\\varepsilon) for (i=0,\\dots,n-1), where (\\varepsilon) is proportional to (\\phi). Thus, the tracking error is ultimately bounded by a constant determined by the boundary‑layer width, providing a practical bound on the steady‑state error.",
