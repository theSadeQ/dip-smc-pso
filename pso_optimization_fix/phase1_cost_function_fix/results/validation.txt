PHASE 1.4: VALIDATE COST FUNCTION FIXES
================================================================================

[Test 1] Very good gains (should have low cost)
  Cost: 0.00000000

[Test 2] Poor gains (should have higher cost)
  Cost: 0.00000000

[Test 3] Very poor gains (should have much higher cost)
  Cost: 0.00000000

================================================================================
VALIDATION RESULTS
================================================================================
[ERROR] Cost function NOT discriminating properly
        Good: 0.000000, Poor: 0.000000, Bad: 0.000000

[INFO] Costs still close - may need harder scenarios for better discrimination

Cost ratio (poor/good): infx
[EXCELLENT] Very strong discrimination (>10x)

================================================================================
FINAL VERDICT
================================================================================
[FAILURE] Cost function still not discriminating properly
