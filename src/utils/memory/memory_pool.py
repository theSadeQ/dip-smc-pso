"""
Production-grade memory pool for efficient memory management.

This module provides a memory pool implementation with automatic coalescing,
fragmentation monitoring, and efficiency tracking. Designed for long-running
simulations and batch operations to minimize memory allocation overhead.

Example:
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from src.utils.memory.memory_pool import MemoryPool
    >>>
    >>> # Create pool with 20 blocks of shape (100,)
    >>> pool = MemoryPool(block_size=(100,), num_blocks=20)
    >>>
    >>> # Allocate blocks
    >>> block1 = pool.get_block()
    >>> block2 = pool.get_block()
    >>>
    >>> # Use blocks...
    >>> np.random.randn(*block1.shape, out=block1)
    >>>
    >>> # Return blocks (auto-coalesces if fragmentation > 20%)
    >>> pool.return_block(0)
    >>> pool.return_block(1)
    >>>
    >>> # Check pool health
    >>> print(f"Efficiency: {pool.get_efficiency():.1f}%")
    >>> print(f"Fragmentation: {pool.get_fragmentation():.1f}%")

    This class manages a fixed pool of pre-allocated numpy arrays to minimize
    allocation overhead during simulation runs. It automatically defragments
    the pool when fragmentation exceeds 20%.

    Attributes:
        block_size: Shape tuple for each block (e.g., (100,) or (10, 10))
        num_blocks: Total number of blocks in the pool
        blocks: List of pre-allocated numpy arrays
        available: List of available block indices
        allocated: List of currently allocated block indices

    Performance Targets:
        - Efficiency: >90% (allocated / total blocks)
        - Fragmentation: <10% after coalescing
        - Coalescing latency: <1ms for typical pool sizes
