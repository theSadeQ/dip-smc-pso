"""
Constraint handling for optimization problems in control systems.
This module provides constraint definitions, violation handling,
and penalty methods for constrained optimization problems
common in control parameter tuning.

# Placeholder for future constraint handling implementations
# Common constraints to implement:
# - Box constraints (parameter bounds)
# - Linear constraints
# - Nonlinear constraints
# - Control system stability constraints

__all__ = []

# Future implementations will include:
# from .bounds import BoxConstraints, ParameterBounds
# from .linear import LinearConstraints, LinearEquality, LinearInequality
# from .nonlinear import NonlinearConstraints, StabilityConstraints
# from .penalty import PenaltyMethods, BarrierMethods, AugmentedLagrangian
# from .violation import ConstraintViolationHandler, ViolationMetrics
