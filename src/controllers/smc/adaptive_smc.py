"""
Adaptive sliding‑mode controller with online gain adaptation.

This implementation follows the classical adaptive SMC structure in
which the switching gain ``K`` is increased when the sliding
surface magnitude exceeds a dead zone and decays toward a nominal
value otherwise.  No control‑rate term is included in the
adaptation law; theoretical analyses show that augmenting the
adaptation with a rate‑dependent term can destabilise the closed
loop and is not required for convergence.
A continuous boundary layer of width ``boundary_layer`` is used to
approximate the discontinuous sign function, reducing chattering
at the expense of steady‑state accuracy.  The
boundary layer thickness must therefore be selected to balance
robustness and tracking error.  All gains
are validated for positivity to satisfy sliding‑mode stability
conditions.

Parameters
----------
gains : list of float
    Five gains in the order ``[k1, k2, lam1, lam2, gamma]``.
dt : float
    Simulation timestep (s); must be strictly positive.
max_force : float
    Saturation limit for the total control input.  Final commands
    are clipped to the interval [−max_force, +max_force].
leak_rate : float
    Leak coefficient that pulls the adaptive gain ``K`` back toward
    its nominal value ``K_init`` over time.  Non‑negative.
adapt_rate_limit : float
    Maximum rate of change allowed for ``K``.  Limits sudden
    growth or decay of the adaptive gain.
K_min, K_max : float
    Lower and upper bounds for ``K``.  These must satisfy
    ``0 < K_min ≤ K_init ≤ K_max``.  Bounding the gain ensures
    the controller remains within a physically reasonable range.
smooth_switch : bool
    If ``True`` the continuous switching function uses a hyperbolic
    tangent; otherwise a linear saturation is used.
boundary_layer : float
    Width of the boundary layer (ε) used in the switching function.
    Must be strictly positive; see [Utkin 1992] for the effects of
    boundary‑layer size on chattering.
dead_zone : float
    Radius around σ=0 in which adaptation is frozen to prevent
    wind‑up.  Outside this zone the adaptive gain increases
    proportionally to ``|σ|``.
K_init : float, optional
    Initial and nominal value of the adaptive gain ``K``.
alpha : float, optional
    Proportional term weighting the sliding surface in the control
    law.  Must be non‑negative.
**kwargs : dict
    Additional unused keyword arguments for forward compatibility.

        Compute the adaptive sliding–mode control law with unified anti‑windup.

        The controller constructs a sliding surface based on the joint
        velocities and positions and generates a switching control using
        either a hyperbolic tangent or a linear saturation function.  The
        adaptive gain ``K`` increases proportionally to the magnitude of the
        sliding surface whenever the system is outside a small dead‑zone and
        remains constant (or decays slowly toward its nominal value) inside
        the dead‑zone.  Unlike some earlier
        implementations, the adaptation law no longer depends on the rate of
        change of the control input; including such a term lacks theoretical
        justification and can destabilise the adaptation process.  A leak
        term pulls ``K`` back toward ``K_init`` over time to prevent
        unbounded growth.  The method returns the saturated control input,
        updated internal state variables, an updated history dictionary and
        the current sliding surface value packaged as a named tuple.  Using
        a structured return type formalises the contract and allows callers
        to access fields by name.

        Parameters
        ----------
        state : np.ndarray
            The full system state [x, θ1, θ2, ẋ, θ̇1, θ̇2].
        state_vars : Tuple[float, float, float]

        history : Dict
            A dictionary storing time series of internal variables.  The
            entries 'K', 'sigma', 'u_sw', 'dK', and 'time_in_sliding'

        -------
        AdaptiveSMCOutput
            A named tuple ``(u, state, history, sigma)`` containing the

            positional index.  This reduces ambiguity and
            preserves backward compatibility because named tuples are
