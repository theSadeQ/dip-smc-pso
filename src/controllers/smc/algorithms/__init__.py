"""
SMC Algorithms Package.

Comprehensive collection of Sliding Mode Control algorithms implemented
with modular architecture for clarity and best practices:

- Classical SMC: Traditional sliding mode control with boundary layer
- Adaptive SMC: Online gain adaptation for unknown uncertainties
- Super-Twisting SMC: Second-order sliding mode for finite-time convergence
- Hybrid SMC: Intelligent switching between multiple SMC algorithms

Each algorithm is split into focused components following single-responsibility principle.
