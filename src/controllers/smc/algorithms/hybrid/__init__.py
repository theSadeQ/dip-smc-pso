"""
Hybrid SMC Algorithm Package.

Modular implementation of Hybrid Sliding Mode Control that intelligently
switches between multiple SMC algorithms based on system conditions:

- Controller: Main orchestration with intelligent switching
- SwitchingLogic: Decision-making logic for controller selection
- Configuration: Type-safe parameter configuration for hybrid operation

This provides optimal performance by selecting the most appropriate SMC algorithm
for current operating conditions, with smooth transitions and performance monitoring.
