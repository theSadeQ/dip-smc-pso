"""
Sliding Mode Controllers for the double inverted pendulum system.

This package provides both legacy monolithic controllers and new modular implementations:

Legacy Controllers (for backward compatibility):
- ClassicalSMC (from classic_smc.py)
- AdaptiveSMC (from adaptive_smc.py)
- SuperTwistingSMC (from sta_smc.py)
- HybridAdaptiveSTASMC (from hybrid_adaptive_sta_smc.py)

New Modular Controllers (recommended for new development):
- All controllers from algorithms package with focused, single-responsibility modules
- Improved maintainability, testing, and extensibility
- Type-safe configurations with mathematical validation
