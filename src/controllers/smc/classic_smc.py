    Classical Sliding‑Mode Controller for a double‑inverted pendulum.

    This controller implements the conventional first‑order sliding‑mode law
    consisting of a model‑based equivalent control ``u_eq`` and a robust
    discontinuous term.  The robust term uses a continuous approximation to
    the sign function (either a hyperbolic tangent or a piecewise‑linear
    saturation) within a boundary layer of width ``epsilon`` to attenuate
    chattering.  Introducing a boundary layer around the switching surface
    replaces the discontinuous signum control with a continuous function,
    thereby reducing high‑frequency oscillations.  A number of authors
    note that the boundary‑layer approximation attenuates chattering at
    the cost of introducing a finite steady‑state tracking error; for
    example, a discussion of chattering reduction methods emphasises
    that the boundary‑layer method "reduces chattering but leads to a finite
    steady state error".  The user should therefore
    select ``epsilon`` to balance chattering reduction against steady‑state
    accuracy.

    Two switching functions are available: ``tanh`` (smooth hyperbolic
    tangent) and ``linear`` (piecewise‑linear saturation).  The ``linear``
    switch approximates the sign function more harshly by clipping the
    sliding surface directly, which can degrade robustness near the origin
    because the control gain effectively drops to zero for small errors.
    In contrast, the ``tanh`` switch retains smoothness and maintains a
    nonzero slope through the origin, preserving control authority in a
    neighbourhood of the sliding surface.  Users should prefer
    ``tanh`` unless there is a compelling reason to adopt the linear
    saturation and should be aware that linear saturation may cause
    increased steady‑state error and slower convergence near the origin.

    A small diagonal ``regularization`` is added to the inertia matrix during
    inversion to ensure positive definiteness and numerical robustness.
    Adding a tiny constant to the diagonal of a symmetric matrix is a
    well‑known regularisation technique: in the context of covariance
    matrices, Leung and colleagues recommend “adding a small, positive
    constant to the diagonal” to ensure the matrix is invertible.

    Parameters are typically supplied by a factory that reads a central
    configuration.  Each gain vector must contain exactly six elements in the
    order ``[k1, k2, lam1, lam2, K, kd]``.  The maximum force ``max_force``
    sets the saturation limit for the final control command.

    The optional ``controllability_threshold`` parameter decouples
    controllability from the boundary layer ``epsilon``.  Earlier
    implementations compared the magnitude of ``L·M^{-1}·B`` against
    ``epsilon`` to decide whether to compute the equivalent control.  This
    conflation of chattering mitigation with controllability made it
    difficult to tune each effect separately.  ``controllability_threshold``
    defines a lower bound on ``|L·M^{-1}·B|`` below which the equivalent
    control is suppressed.  If unspecified, a default of ``1e‑4`` is used
    based on matrix conditioning guidelines.  The
    boundary layer width ``epsilon`` should therefore be chosen solely to
    trade off between chattering and steady‑state error, while
    ``controllability_threshold`` governs when the model‑based feedforward
    term is applied.

    **Gain positivity (F‑4.SMCDesign.2 / RC‑04)** – Sliding‑mode theory
    requires that the sliding‑surface gains ``k1``, ``k2`` and the slope
    coefficients ``lam1``, ``lam2`` be strictly positive.  Utkin and
    Levant note that the discontinuous control gain ``k`` must be a
    positive constant【Rhif2012†L563-L564】, and the slope ``λ`` of the
    sliding function must be chosen positive to ensure Hurwitz
    stability【ModelFreeSMC2018†L340-L345】.  The switching gain ``K`` must
    also be strictly positive to drive the system to the sliding surface,
    while the derivative gain ``kd`` should be non‑negative to provide
    damping.  The constructor validates these constraints and raises
    ``ValueError`` when violated.
