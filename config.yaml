# ISSUE #2 RESOLUTION: STA-SMC Overshoot Optimization
# Problem: Excessive overshoot (>20%) with original gains [15,8,12,6,20,4]
# Root Cause: Overly aggressive sliding surface coefficients λ1=20.0, λ2=4.0
# Solution: Optimized surface coefficients for target damping ζ=0.7
# Result: Reduced overshoot from >20% to <5% while maintaining stability
# Technical Details: docs/issue_2_surface_design_theory.md
# Validation: analysis/issue_2_surface_design_analysis.py

# ISSUE #18 RESOLUTION: FDI Threshold Calibration & False Positive Elimination
# Problem: Threshold 0.1 too sensitive, causing false positives at t=0.05s (residual=0.1332)
# Root Cause: Threshold too close to mean residual (0.103) with high noise (σ=0.044)
# Solution: Statistically calibrated threshold based on P99 percentile analysis (1,167 samples)
# Result: Threshold 0.150 provides 6x improvement (15.9% FP vs ~80% with 0.1)
# Technical Details: artifacts/fdi_threshold_calibration_report.json
# Hysteresis: 10% deadband prevents threshold oscillation near boundary
