# ISSUE #2 RESOLUTION: STA-SMC Overshoot Optimization
# Problem: Excessive overshoot (>20%) with original gains [15,8,12,6,20,4]
# Root Cause: Overly aggressive sliding surface coefficients λ1=20.0, λ2=4.0
# Solution: Optimized surface coefficients for target damping ζ=0.7
# Result: Reduced overshoot from >20% to <5% while maintaining stability
# Technical Details: docs/issue_2_surface_design_theory.md

# ISSUE #18 RESOLUTION: FDI Threshold Calibration & False Positive Elimination
# Problem: Threshold 0.1 too sensitive, causing false positives at t=0.05s (residual=0.1332)
# Root Cause: Threshold too close to mean residual (0.103) with high noise (σ=0.044)
# Solution: Statistically calibrated threshold based on P99 percentile analysis (1,167 samples)
# Result: Threshold 0.150 provides 6x improvement (15.9% FP vs ~80% with 0.1)
# Technical Details: artifacts/fdi_threshold_calibration_report.json
# Hysteresis: 10% deadband prevents threshold oscillation near boundary

# MT-8 ROBUST PSO OPTIMIZATION (November 8, 2025)
# Problem: Default gains FAIL under disturbances (187-667° overshoots, 0% convergence)
# Solution: Robust PSO with disturbance-aware fitness (50% nominal + 50% disturbed)
# Configuration: 30 particles × 50 iterations (~4,500 evaluations per controller)
# Disturbances: Step (10N @ t=2s), Impulse (30N pulse @ t=2s, 0.1s duration)
# Result: 6.35% avg improvement | Hybrid controller: 21.4% improvement (best)
