TRL Classification:
Level 6 (Production-Deployed) - These are the gains currently deployed in the
production configuration file (config.yaml). They represent the highest maturity
level for deployment readiness.

Maturity Assessment:
- Theoretical Bounds: ✅ Pass (all gains within stability-informed bounds)
- Simulation Validation: ✅ Pass (Phase 53 gains used)
- Statistical Validation: ⚠️ Partial (STA only, others pending MT-7)
- Robustness Validation: ✅ Pass (MT-8 tested for all controllers)
- Hardware Validation: ⚠️ Partial (preliminary HIL only)
- Production Deployment: ✅ DEPLOYED (in config.yaml lines 39-83)

Production Gains Source:
The current config.yaml uses a mix of optimization results:
- Default gains: Derived from MT-8 robust optimization (50% nominal + 50% disturbed)
- Fallback: Phase 53 gains for nominal conditions
- Quality: All controllers have Level 4 robustness validation minimum

Configuration Location:
**File:** config.yaml
**Lines 39-83:** Controller default gains (controller_defaults section)
**Lines 186-229:** PSO parameter bounds (pso.bounds section)

Deployment Controllers:
1. **Classical SMC** (Lines 40-46)
   - 6 parameters: λ1, λ2, k1, k2, φ1, φ2
   - Source: MT-8 robust gains (Level 4)
   - Maturity: Level 4 (robustness-validated)

2. **STA SMC** (Lines 48-54)
   - 6 parameters: λ1, λ2, k1, k2, α1, α2
   - Source: MT-8 robust gains (Level 4)
   - Maturity: Level 4+ (robustness + statistical validation)
   - Note: Highest maturity controller (only one with MT-7)

3. **Adaptive SMC** (Lines 56-65)
   - 5 parameters: γ1, γ2, k1, k2, σ
   - Source: MT-8 robust gains (Level 4)
   - Maturity: Level 4 (robustness-validated)

4. **Hybrid Adaptive STA** (Lines 67-77)
   - 5 parameters: γ1, γ2, α1, α2, σ
   - Source: MT-8 robust gains (Level 4)
   - Maturity: Level 4 (robustness-validated, BEST disturbance rejection)

Quality Gates for Production:
✅ All controllers passed:
1. Theoretical bounds validation
2. Simulation validation (nominal conditions)
3. Robustness validation (MT-8: 15 disturbance scenarios)
4. Configuration validation (Pydantic schema)

⚠️ Partial/Pending:
1. Statistical validation (only STA has MT-7)
2. Hardware validation (preliminary HIL only)
3. Long-term stability testing

Production Deployment Workflow:
1. Gains optimized via PSO (Phase 53 or MT-8)
2. Validation against quality gates
3. Manual review and approval
4. Update config.yaml controller_defaults
5. Integration testing
6. Version control and deployment

Version Control:
- Current config.yaml tracked in git
- Gains updates require commit + review
- Rollback available via git history

Use Cases:
- Reference for currently deployed gains
- Baseline for new optimization campaigns
- Production system configuration
- Quality assurance and auditing

- Level 2 (Simulation): Phase 53 nominal-optimized gains
- Level 4 (Robustness): MT-8 robust-optimized gains

Recommendation:
This is the authoritative source for production gains. Any changes must:
1. Pass quality gates (minimum Level 4 robustness validation)
2. Be reviewed and approved
3. Be version-controlled via git
4. Include rollback plan

- Level 4 shortcuts for robustness-validated gains
- Level 2 shortcuts for nominal-optimized gains
- MT-8 validation reports for performance comparisons
