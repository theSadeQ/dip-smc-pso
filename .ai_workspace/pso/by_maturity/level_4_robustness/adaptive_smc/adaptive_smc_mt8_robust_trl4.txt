TRL Classification:
Level 4 (Robustness-Validated) - These gains have been validated against disturbances
and uncertainty via MT-8 robust multi-scenario PSO. Represents a balance between
nominal accuracy and disturbance robustness.

Maturity Assessment:
- Theoretical Bounds: ✅ Pass (within stability-informed bounds)
- Simulation Validation: ✅ Pass (nominal + disturbed conditions)
- Statistical Validation: ❌ Not tested (MT-7 multi-seed pending)
- Robustness Validation: ✅ Pass (MT-8: 15 disturbance scenarios tested)
- Hardware Validation: ❌ Not tested (HIL pending)
- Production Deployment: ✅ Deployed (in config.yaml)

MT-8 Optimization Details:
- Fitness Function: 50% nominal RMSE + 50% disturbed RMSE
- Scenarios: 15 disturbance conditions (force disturbances, parameter variations)
- Improvement: +8.2% vs baseline disturbance rejection (2nd best)
- Trade-off: Moderate nominal performance loss (~8%)

Quality Gates to Level 5 (Hardware):
1. Run HIL validation on physical testbed
2. Verify adaptive algorithm convergence in real hardware
3. Document online adaptation behavior under disturbances

Use Cases:
- Applications requiring good disturbance rejection
- Online parameter adaptation under varying conditions
- Balance between accuracy and robustness

Performance Metrics:
- Nominal RMSE: 0.0335 (degradation from Phase 53 baseline 0.0289)
- Disturbed RMSE: 0.0450 (+8.2% vs baseline disturbance rejection)
- Disturbance Rejection Improvement: +8.2% (2nd best among controllers)
- Settling Time: ~2.2s (under disturbances)
- Adaptation: Online gain adjustment helps under disturbances

Trade-offs vs Phase 53:
- Nominal Performance: -8% (RMSE 0.0335 vs 0.0289)
- Disturbed Performance: +8.2% (improved disturbance rejection)
- Overall: Good disturbance robustness, but sacrifices some nominal accuracy

Strengths:
- 2nd best disturbance rejection (+8.2%)
- Online adaptation benefits robustness
- No boundary layer tuning required

Weaknesses:
- No statistical validation (MT-7 not run)
- Larger nominal performance trade-off vs STA SMC
- More complex than Classical/STA

Recommendation:
Use when disturbance rejection is important but statistical validation not required.
Consider STA SMC for similar robustness with smaller nominal performance trade-off.
