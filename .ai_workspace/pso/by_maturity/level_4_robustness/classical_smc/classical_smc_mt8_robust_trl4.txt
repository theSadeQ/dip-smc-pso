TRL Classification:
Level 4 (Robustness-Validated) - These gains have been validated against disturbances
and uncertainty scenarios via MT-8 robust multi-scenario PSO optimization.

Maturity Assessment:
- Theoretical Bounds: ✅ Pass (within stability-informed bounds)
- Simulation Validation: ✅ Pass (nominal + disturbed conditions)
- Statistical Validation: ❌ Not tested (MT-7 multi-seed pending)
- Robustness Validation: ✅ Pass (MT-8: 15 disturbance scenarios tested)
- Hardware Validation: ⚠️ Partial (preliminary HIL only)
- Production Deployment: ❌ Not deployed (Phase 53 gains used instead)

MT-8 Optimization Details:
- Fitness Function: 50% nominal RMSE + 50% disturbed RMSE
- Scenarios: 15 disturbance conditions (force disturbances, parameter variations)
- Improvement: +3.5% vs baseline disturbance rejection
- Trade-off: Slight nominal performance loss (~5%) for improved robustness

Quality Gates to Level 5 (Hardware):
1. Run HIL validation on physical testbed
2. Verify disturbance rejection in real hardware
3. Document actuator saturation and safety limits

Use Cases:
- Applications with external disturbances (wind, vibrations, load variations)
- Robustness-critical deployments
- Real-world conditions with uncertainty

Performance Metrics:
- Nominal RMSE: 0.0510 (slight degradation from Phase 53 baseline 0.0485)
- Disturbed RMSE: 0.0680 (+3.5% vs baseline disturbance rejection)
- Disturbance Rejection Improvement: +3.5% (4th best among controllers)
- Settling Time: ~2.7s (under disturbances)
- Robustness: Good (validated across 15 scenarios)

Trade-offs vs Phase 53:
- Nominal Performance: -5% (RMSE 0.0510 vs 0.0485)
- Disturbed Performance: +3.5% (improved disturbance rejection)
- Overall: Better for real-world deployment with disturbances

Recommendation:
Use for production deployments where external disturbances are expected.
Accept slight nominal performance loss for improved real-world robustness.
