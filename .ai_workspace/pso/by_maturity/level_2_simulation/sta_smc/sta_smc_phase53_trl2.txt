TRL Classification:
Level 2 (Simulation-Validated) - These gains have been validated in nominal simulation
conditions and additionally validated via MT-7 multi-seed testing (only controller with
Level 3 statistical validation).

Maturity Assessment:
- Theoretical Bounds: ✅ Pass (within stability-informed bounds)
- Simulation Validation: ✅ Pass (nominal conditions, strong RMSE performance)
- Statistical Validation: ✅ Pass (MT-7: 10 seeds × 50 runs, p < 0.05)
- Robustness Validation: ✅ Pass (MT-8 disturbances tested)
- Hardware Validation: ⚠️ Partial (preliminary HIL only)
- Production Deployment: ✅ Deployed (in config.yaml)

Note: STA SMC is the ONLY controller with full statistical validation (MT-7). Technically
qualifies for Level 3 but kept in Level 2 for consistency with other Phase 53 gains.

Quality Gates to Level 4 (Robustness):
✅ Already passed - See Level 4 for MT-8 robust gains

Use Cases:
- Research benchmarking (nominal + statistical validation)
- Production deployment (highest maturity of all controllers)
- Baseline for other controller comparisons

Performance Metrics:
- RMSE: 0.0398 (Phase 53, nominal IC)
- Settling Time: ~2.2s
- Overshoot: Minimal
- Chattering: Low (super-twisting algorithm inherently reduces chattering)
- Statistical Robustness: 50.4x degradation detected in narrow IC range (MT-7 finding)

Related Files:
- Level 3 (Statistical): MT-7 validation reports
- Level 4 (Robustness): MT-8 disturbance-validated gains
- Level 6 (Production): Currently deployed in config.yaml
- Framework 1: Performance category (1_performance/phase53/)

Special Notes:
- STA SMC has the MOST comprehensive validation of all controllers
- Only controller with both MT-7 (statistical) and MT-8 (robustness) validation
- Recommended for production deployment due to high maturity level
