TRL Classification:
Level 2 (Simulation-Validated) - These gains have been validated in nominal simulation
conditions but have NOT been tested for statistical significance, robustness to
disturbances, or hardware deployment.

Maturity Assessment:
- Theoretical Bounds: ✅ Pass (within stability-informed bounds)
- Simulation Validation: ✅ Pass (nominal conditions, RMSE baseline)
- Statistical Validation: ❌ Not tested (MT-7 multi-seed pending)
- Robustness Validation: ❌ Not tested (MT-8 disturbances pending)
- Hardware Validation: ❌ Not tested (HIL pending)
- Production Deployment: ❌ Not deployed

Quality Gates to Level 3 (Statistical):
1. Run MT-7 multi-seed validation (10 seeds × 50 runs)
2. Achieve p-value < 0.05 in Welch's t-test
3. Document statistical significance vs baseline

Use Cases:
- Research benchmarking (nominal conditions)
- Initial controller tuning
- Baseline performance comparison

Performance Metrics:
- RMSE: 0.0485 (Phase 53, nominal IC)
- Settling Time: ~2.5s
- Overshoot: Minimal
- Chattering: Moderate (boundary layer ε = 0.02)
