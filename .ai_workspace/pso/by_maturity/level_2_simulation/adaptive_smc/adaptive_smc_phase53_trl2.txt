TRL Classification:
Level 2 (Simulation-Validated) - These gains have been validated in nominal simulation
conditions and represent the BEST PERFORMANCE of all controllers (RMSE: 0.0289).

Maturity Assessment:
- Theoretical Bounds: ✅ Pass (within stability-informed bounds)
- Simulation Validation: ✅ Pass (nominal conditions, BEST RMSE performance)
- Statistical Validation: ❌ Not tested (MT-7 multi-seed pending)
- Robustness Validation: ✅ Pass (MT-8 disturbances tested)
- Hardware Validation: ❌ Not tested (HIL pending)
- Production Deployment: ✅ Deployed (in config.yaml)

Quality Gates to Level 3 (Statistical):
1. Run MT-7 multi-seed validation (10 seeds × 50 runs)
2. Achieve p-value < 0.05 in Welch's t-test
3. Verify 40.4% performance advantage holds across seeds

Use Cases:
- Maximum accuracy applications (best RMSE performance)
- Research benchmarking (performance baseline)
- Applications where online adaptation is beneficial

Performance Metrics:
- RMSE: 0.0289 (Phase 53, nominal IC) ← BEST PERFORMANCE
- Improvement vs Classical: +40.4%
- Settling Time: ~2.0s
- Overshoot: Minimal
- Chattering: N/A (no boundary layer, adaptive gains)

Strengths:
- Highest tracking accuracy (40.4% better than Classical)
- Online parameter adaptation
- No manual boundary layer tuning required

Weaknesses:
- No statistical validation (MT-7 not run)
- Robustness only tested via MT-8 (not comprehensive)
- More complex than Classical/STA

- Level 6 (Production): Currently deployed gains in config.yaml
- Framework 1: Performance category (1_performance/phase53/)

Recommendation:
Use for applications prioritizing maximum accuracy over robustness guarantees.
Consider running MT-7 validation before production deployment if statistical
confidence is required.
