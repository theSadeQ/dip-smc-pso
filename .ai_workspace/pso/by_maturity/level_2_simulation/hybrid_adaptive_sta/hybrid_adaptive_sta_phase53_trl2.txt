TRL Classification:
Level 2 (Simulation-Validated) - These gains have been validated in nominal simulation
conditions and represent a balanced trade-off between Adaptive SMC (accuracy) and
STA SMC (chattering reduction).

Maturity Assessment:
- Theoretical Bounds: ✅ Pass (within stability-informed bounds)
- Simulation Validation: ✅ Pass (nominal conditions, 2nd best RMSE)
- Statistical Validation: ❌ Not tested (MT-7 multi-seed pending)
- Robustness Validation: ✅ Pass (MT-8: BEST disturbance rejection +21.4%)
- Hardware Validation: ❌ Not tested (HIL pending)
- Production Deployment: ✅ Deployed (in config.yaml)

Quality Gates to Level 3 (Statistical):
1. Run MT-7 multi-seed validation (10 seeds × 50 runs)
2. Achieve p-value < 0.05 in Welch's t-test
3. Verify balanced performance holds across seeds

Use Cases:
- Balanced accuracy + robustness (best of both worlds)
- Disturbance rejection applications (MT-8: +21.4% best performer)
- Production deployment (good maturity, strong robustness)

Performance Metrics:
- RMSE: 0.0315 (Phase 53, nominal IC) ← 2nd best performance
- Improvement vs Classical: +35.1%
- Disturbance Rejection: +21.4% vs baseline (MT-8) ← BEST ROBUSTNESS
- Settling Time: ~2.1s
- Overshoot: Minimal
- Chattering: Low (STA component reduces chattering)

Strengths:
- BEST disturbance rejection (+21.4% in MT-8)
- Balanced performance + robustness
- Combines adaptive gains with super-twisting algorithm
- Strong production readiness

Weaknesses:
- No statistical validation (MT-7 not run)
- Slightly lower accuracy than pure Adaptive SMC
- More complex than Classical/STA

Related Files:
- Level 4 (Robustness): MT-8 disturbance-validated gains (BEST performer)
- Level 6 (Production): Currently deployed gains in config.yaml
- Framework 1: Performance category (1_performance/phase53/)

Recommendation:
RECOMMENDED for production deployment due to:
1. Strong robustness (MT-8 validated)
2. Good accuracy (2nd best RMSE)
3. Balanced trade-offs (accuracy + robustness)
4. Low chattering (STA component)

Ideal for applications requiring reliable performance under real-world disturbances.
