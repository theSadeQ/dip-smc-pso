Week 3:  Phase 1.5 (Agent 5) launches
Week 4:  Buffer & documentation
Week 5:  Level 1 COMPLETE → Level 2 ready
```

**Command**: `/start-level-1-parallel-phases`

### Option B: SEQUENTIAL (SAFER)
**Timeline**: 8-10 weeks
**Agents**: 1 (phases run one after another)
**Efficiency**: Safest approach
**Coordination**: Manual phase transitions

```
Week 2-3:   Phase 1.2 (Agent 2) completes

## GUARANTEE: LEVEL-BY-LEVEL CHECKPOINTS

As you requested: **"checkpoint level by level"**

- ✅ Phase 1.1 → LEVEL_1_COMPLETE.json (checkpoint after all 5 phases)
- ✅ Levels 1.2-1.5 can be interrupted anytime
- ✅ Recovery via `/recover` → `/resume-level-1`
- ✅ After Level 1 complete → LEVEL_2_CHECKPOINT.json
- ✅ Same pattern for Levels 2, 3, 4

**Each Level = 1 master checkpoint file**
**Within each level = phase checkpoints for recovery**
