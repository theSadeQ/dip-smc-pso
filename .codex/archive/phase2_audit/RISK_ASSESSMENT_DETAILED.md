# Risk Assessment (Detailed)

Probability expressed as percentage likelihood during Phase 2 execution. Impact scored 1 (negligible) to 10 (critical). **Risk score = Probability × Impact**. Items with score ≥40 require proactive mitigation before Phase 2 kickoff.

| ID | Risk Description | Probability (%) | Impact (1-10) | Risk Score | Mitigation Plan | Contingency / Trigger | Owner |
|----|------------------|-----------------|---------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-------|
| R1 | Muted text token change reduces contrast in dark mode copies of docs. | 45 | 8 | 36 | Update dark-mode token simultaneously; run automated contrast check (axe) on light/dark variants. | Roll back via token toggle in feature branch; keep `design_tokens_v1` alias for hotfix. | UX Designer |
| R2 | Sphinx templating refactor for code controls breaks copy button JS. | 35 | 9 | 31.5 | Pair accessibility specialist with FED to rewrite template + regression tests; add Cypress smoke test for copy button. | Temporarily disable collapse feature behind feature flag and ship quick fix to restore copy. | Frontend Dev |
| R3 | Quick wins slip because developer availability is <14 hours. | 55 | 7 | 38.5 | Pre-book dev capacity during Week 2; prepare design-ready specs by Day 5. | Move quick wins to Phase 3 and communicate variance in completion report. | Design Lead |
| R4 | Stakeholder review cycles exceed planned 3-day window, blocking Wave 2 start. | 60 | 6 | 36 | Provide async Loom walkthrough + annotated mockups; secure dates in calendars upfront. | Escalate to project sponsor; overlap Waves 2 & 3 tasks with clear risk note. | PM / Design Lead |
| R5 | Streamlit CSS injection collides with future Streamlit upgrade (>=1.41). | 30 | 8 | 24 | Encapsulate overrides in namespaced wrapper; document fallback to official theming API. | If upgrade breaks styling, toggle off overrides via config flag and log issue for Streamlit 2.0 alignment. | Frontend Dev |
| R6 | Responsive utilities introduce layout shift (>0.15 CLS) on mobile. | 40 | 7 | 28 | Use Chrome Lighthouse on staging for each breakpoint; add layout regression snapshots (Percy). | Roll back offending utility and revert to previous spacing until fixed. | QA Lead |
| R7 | Accessibility fixes fail NVDA/JAWS parity due to untested screen reader combos. | 25 | 10 | 25 | Schedule screen reader pairing sessions (NVDA/Chrome, JAWS/Edge, VoiceOver/Safari). | If failure detected post-launch, ship hotfix revert + escalate to compliance team. | Accessibility Specialist |
| R8 | Hyphenation fix relies on `lang` attribute consistency; localized pages missing attribute. | 35 | 6 | 21 | Audit HTML `<html lang>` across generated docs; add fallback `overflow-wrap: anywhere` for unknown locales. | Provide manual overrides per locale file and log translation task. | Technical Writer |
| R9 | New spacing utilities conflict with legacy classes in `base-theme.css`. | 50 | 5 | 25 | Run `rg` for legacy spacing rules; document deprecation and shim old classes to new values. | If collision found after deployment, reintroduce old class mapping via CSS alias file. | Frontend Dev |
| R10 | Increased CSS payload (>10KB) hurts LCP budget. | 30 | 6 | 18 | Track bundle size via `size-limit`; inline critical CSS only when necessary; remove unused variants. | If limit exceeded, conditionally load rarely used themes (e.g., gradients) lazily. | Frontend Dev |
| R11 | QA effort underestimated; validation procedures lack bandwidth. | 45 | 7 | 31.5 | Provide explicit test scripts (see VALIDATION_PROCEDURES.md); allocate 2 QA cycles per week. | Shift some validation to designers with accessibility tools; extend schedule buffer by 2 days. | PM / QA Lead |
| R12 | Token versioning confusion causes devs to mix v1/v2 values. | 40 | 6 | 24 | Ship migration guide + automated lint rule (`stylelint-declaration-property-value-disallowed-list`). | If mixed tokens detected, block merge via CI check. | Design Ops |
| R13 | Brand team rejects color adjustments, delaying approval. | 25 | 7 | 17.5 | Present contrast data + user impact scores early; share side-by-side comps. | Offer alternative (Option B in alternatives doc) and flag schedule slip in decision log. | Design Lead |
| R14 | Coverage matrix enhancements require JavaScript sticky header not currently scoped. | 35 | 5 | 17.5 | Define MVP CSS-only sticky solution; keep JS enhancement as stretch goal. | If CSS fails, backlog JS solution for Phase 3 with risk note. | Frontend Dev |
| R15 | Streamlit theme alignment breaks when users toggle wide mode. | 20 | 6 | 12 | Test Streamlit layout with wide mode on/off; ensure CSS selectors scoped to `.main` container. | Provide instructions to disable wide mode temporarily; log bug upstream. | Frontend Dev |
| R16 | Documentation generator cache invalidation misses new assets (mockups, tokens). | 30 | 4 | 12 | Update build pipeline to bust `_static` on each build; document manual clear command. | If stale assets observed, publish hotfix run with `sphinx-build -E`. | DevOps |
| R17 | Legal/compliance demands VPAT before Phase 2 ends. | 15 | 9 | 13.5 | Clarify compliance scope with Accessibility Office during kickoff; provide progress evidence. | If forced, negotiate Phase 2 extension or partial VPAT with known gaps documented. | PM |
