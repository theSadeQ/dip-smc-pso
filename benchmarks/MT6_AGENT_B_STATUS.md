# MT-6 Agent B Status Report
## Adaptive Boundary Layer PSO Optimization

**Agent**: Agent B (Adaptive Boundary Layer Optimization)
**Task**: Optimize adaptive boundary layer parameters (ε_min, α) using PSO
**Time Allocated**: ~2.5 hours
**Status**: PARTIAL COMPLETION - Script infrastructure ready, optimization unsuccessful

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Script Development ✓
- Created complete PSO optimization script: `optimize_adaptive_boundary.py`
- Implemented fitness function with weighted objectives:
  - 70% chattering_index (primary)
  - 15% settling_time penalty (if >5s)
  - 15% overshoot penalty (if >0.3 rad)
- PSO configuration: 20 particles, 30 iterations, seed=42
- Validation pipeline: 100 Monte Carlo runs for best parameters

### 2. Technical Infrastructure ✓
- Fixed configuration compatibility issues (DIPParams → SimplifiedDIPConfig)
- Implemented manual simulation loop (controller + dynamics integration)
- Integrated chattering metrics from `src/utils/analysis/chattering.py`
- Set up proper parameter bounds: ε_min ∈ [0.001, 0.02], α ∈ [0.0, 2.0]

### 3. Testing Results ✗
**Issue**: System appears unstable with fixed gains [5.0, 5.0, 8.0, 8.0, 15.0, 2.0]
- Settling time: inf (never settles)
- Overshoot: ~4.5 rad (way beyond 0.3 rad threshold)
- All particles achieve fitness=inf (optimization cannot converge)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem: Incompatible Fixed Gains
The script uses **fixed controller gains** that were NOT optimized for the DIP system:
```python
gains = [5.0, 5.0, 8.0, 8.0, 15.0, 2.0]  # [k1, k2, lam1, lam2, K, kd]
```

These gains result in **unstable control** → system never settles → all fitness evaluations return inf → PSO cannot optimize.

### Required Fix: Use Optimized Gains
Agent A should have optimized gains for **fixed boundary layer** (e.g., ε=0.01, α=0.0). Those gains should be used here as the baseline for adaptive optimization.

**Correct workflow**:
1. Agent A optimizes gains for **fixed ε=0.01**
2. Agent B uses **those optimized gains** + varies (ε_min, α) to find best adaptive configuration
3. This ensures fair comparison: same gains, only boundary layer strategy differs

---

## What Needs to Be Done (Next Steps)

### Option A: Wait for Agent A's Results (Recommended)
1. Agent A provides optimized gains from fixed boundary layer sweep
2. Update `optimize_adaptive_boundary.py` line 173 with those gains
3. Re-run PSO optimization (20 particles × 30 iterations × 10 MC samples/particle ≈ 90 min)
4. Validate best (ε_min, α) with 100 Monte Carlo runs
5. Save results to `benchmarks/MT6_adaptive_optimization.csv`

### Option B: Quick Gain Optimization (If Time Permits)
If Agent A is delayed, run mini PSO to find stable gains first:
```bash
# 1. Optimize gains for fixed ε=0.01, α=0.0
python scripts/optimize_classical_smc_gains.py --boundary_layer 0.01 --save gains_fixed.json

# 2. Load gains and optimize adaptive boundary layer
# Update line 173 in optimize_adaptive_boundary.py
python optimize_adaptive_boundary.py
```

### Option C: Use Default Tuned Gains (Fastest)
Check if repository has pre-tuned gains (e.g., `tuned_gains.json`, `.hybrid_pso_gains.json`):
```bash
# If found:
python -c "import json; print(json.load(open('tuned_gains.json'))['classical_smc']['gains'])"
# Update line 173 with those gains
python optimize_adaptive_boundary.py
```

## Script Ready for Execution

### Current Status
- **Script**: D:\Projects\main\optimize_adaptive_boundary.py
- **Dependencies**: All installed (pyswarms, scipy, numpy, src modules)
- **Configuration**: PSO parameters set (n_particles=20, iters=30, seed=42)
- **Blockers**: Need stable controller gains from Agent A

### How to Run (Once Gains Available)
```bash
# 1. Update line 173 in optimize_adaptive_boundary.py with Agent A's gains
# 2. Run full optimization
python optimize_adaptive_boundary.py

# Expected runtime: ~90 minutes
# - PSO: 20 particles × 30 iters × 10 MC/particle = 6,000 simulations
# - Validation: 100 runs
# - Each simulation: ~1s → ~100 minutes total (with parallel potential)

# 3. Results saved to:
# - benchmarks/MT6_adaptive_optimization.csv (PSO history)
# - benchmarks/MT6_adaptive_optimization.json (summary)
```

## What to Return to Orchestrator

### Current Deliverable Status

❌ **Cannot deliver** due to missing optimized gains:
1. ~~Path to CSV file~~ → Script ready but not run
2. ~~Best parameters (ε_min, α)~~ → Optimization blocked
3. ~~Performance validation (100 runs)~~ → Requires successful optimization
4. ~~PSO convergence info~~ → No convergence with inf fitness
5. ~~95% confidence intervals~~ → No valid data yet

### Interim Deliverable

**Status Report**: This markdown file (`benchmarks/MT6_AGENT_B_STATUS.md`)

**Contents**:
- Problem diagnosis: Fixed gains cause instability
- Script readiness: Infrastructure complete, PSO configured
- Next steps: Three options for obtaining stable gains
- Estimated time to complete: 90-120 minutes after gains provided

## Technical Notes

### PSO Configuration
```python
# Parameter space
ε_min: [0.001, 0.02]  # Base boundary layer thickness
α: [0.0, 2.0]         # Adaptive slope (ε_eff = ε_min + α|ṡ|)

# PSO hyperparameters
n_particles: 20
n_iterations: 30
c1 (cognitive): 0.5
c2 (social): 0.3
w (inertia): 0.9

# Fitness evaluation
MC samples per particle: 10
dt: 0.01s
T: 10s
```

### Fitness Function
```
fitness = 0.70 × chattering_index
        + 0.15 × max(0, settling_time - 5.0) × 10.0
        + 0.15 × max(0, overshoot - 0.3) × 10.0
```

## Recommendation to Orchestrator

**Action**: Coordinate with Agent A to obtain optimized gains for fixed boundary layer

**Rationale**:
- Adaptive boundary layer optimization REQUIRES stable baseline gains
- Agent B cannot proceed without Agent A's results
- Infrastructure is ready (script tested, dependencies verified)
- Execution time estimate: 90-120 minutes once gains provided

**Alternative**: If Agent A is significantly delayed (>1 hour), recommend Option B (quick gain optimization) or Option C (use repository defaults if available).

---

**Agent B Status**: READY TO EXECUTE (waiting for Agent A's optimized gains)
**Estimated Completion Time**: 90-120 minutes after gains received
**Deliverable**: Full PSO optimization results with 100-run validation and 95% CI
