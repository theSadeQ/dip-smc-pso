### Hour-by-Hour Roadmap

| Hour | Modules | Category | Time | Expected Coverage |
|------|---------|----------|------|-------------------|
| 1 | sta_smc, adaptive_smc | Controllers | 60 min | 78% |
| 2 | hybrid_adaptive_sta_smc, swing_up_smc | Controllers | 60 min | 80% |

| 5 | vector_sim, plant/core/base.py | Simulation + Plant | 60 min | 87% |
| 6 | plant/core/interfaces.py + Measurement + Cleanup | Plant + Wrap-up | 60 min | 88%+ |

### Test Template Provided
- ✅ Minimal test class template (copy-paste ready)
- ✅ Examples for each module type
- ✅ 15-25 tests per module guideline
- ✅ Coverage goal: 80%+ per module

### Commit Message Template
```bash
git commit -m "test: Add comprehensive tests for [MODULE_NAME] (Priority 1 [CATEGORY])

[Description and impact metrics]

[AI]"
```

## KEY DOCUMENTS CREATED

| Document | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| **SESSION_5_PLAN.md** | `.project/ai/planning/workspace_audit_2025_10/SESSION_5_PLAN.md` | Complete 5-6 hour execution guide |
| **SESSION_5_SUMMARY.md** | This file | Session recap and next steps |
| **Git Branch** | `refactor/phase3-comprehensive-cleanup` | Safe isolated working environment |
| **Git Tag** | `phase3-start-20251029_*` | Rollback checkpoint |

---

## READY FOR NEXT EXECUTION

### To Start Session 5 Execution:

```bash
cd D:/Projects/main

# Verify you're on the right branch
git branch
# Should show: * refactor/phase3-comprehensive-cleanup

# Read the execution plan
cat ".project/ai/planning/workspace_audit_2025_10/SESSION_5_PLAN.md"

# Start with Module 2 (sta_smc.py)
Read("D:/Projects/main/src/controllers/smc/sta_smc.py")

# Follow the hour-by-hour roadmap and use the test template
```

### Parallel Sessions Possible:

If you have help, multiple people can work on different modules simultaneously:
- Person A: Controllers (Modules 2-6)
- Person B: Dynamics + Simulation (Modules 7-10)
- Person C: Plant core (Modules 11-12)

All working in same branch, each person on own feature sub-branch if desired.

## STRATEGIC RATIONALE

### Why Focus on Task 2 (Test Coverage) First?

1. **Highest Impact:** Tests improve code quality → enable confident refactoring
2. **Lowest Risk:** Additive changes only (no breaking changes)
3. **Enables Future Work:** Task 1 (directory flattening) becomes much safer with 95%+ coverage
4. **Quickest Wins:** Already have 178/231 files with tests; just need 15 more

### Why Task 1 (Directory Flattening) is Deferred:

1. **Higher Risk:** Affects hundreds of imports and file paths
2. **More Complex:** Requires careful coordination across entire codebase
3. **Better With Tests:** Much safer to refactor with comprehensive test coverage as safety net

### Why NOT Task 3 (Documentation):

1. **Low Impact:** Docs don't affect code quality or functionality
2. **Can Wait:** Only 2 hours of work, can do anytime

**Recommended Order:** Task 2 (Test) → Task 1 (Flatten) → Task 3 (Docs)

## METRICS & TRACKING

### Current State (Session 5 Start)
- Test files: 178
- Source files: 231
- Coverage ratio: 77.1%
- Git branch: main (now refactor/phase3-comprehensive-cleanup)
- Last commit: from 2025-10-26

### Expected State (Session 5 End)
- Test files: 193+ (15 new)
- Source files: 231 (unchanged)
- Coverage ratio: 88%+ (target)
- Git branch: refactor/phase3-comprehensive-cleanup
- Commits: 15+ new test commits

### Success Metrics
- ✅ Minimum: 8 modules tested (4h) → 186 test files → 82%+ coverage
- ✅ Target: 10 modules tested (5h) → 188 test files → 83%+ coverage
- ✅ Stretch: 12-15 modules tested (6h) → 193 test files → 88%+ coverage

---

## ROLLBACK & SAFETY

### If Something Goes Wrong:
```bash
# Reset to session start
git reset --hard phase3-start-*

# Or switch back to main
git checkout main
git branch -D refactor/phase3-comprehensive-cleanup
```

### Backups Created:
- ✅ Branch backup: `phase3-backup-20251029`
- ✅ Tag backup: `phase3-start-20251029_*`
- ✅ All changes committed and pushed to remote

---

## NEXT SESSIONS (Post Session-5)

### Session 6: Continue Test Coverage
- Time: 5-6 hours
- Goal: Test remaining Priority 1 modules + start Priority 2
- Target: 90%+ coverage ratio

### Session 7: Complete Test Coverage
- Time: 5-6 hours
- Goal: Complete Priority 2 + Priority 3 modules
- Target: **95%+ coverage ratio** (Task 2 COMPLETE)

### Session 8+: Directory Flattening + Documentation
- Task 1: Flatten deep directories (6-8 hours, safer with test coverage)
- Task 3: Clean legacy docs (2 hours)
- Result: **Phase 3 COMPLETE** (8.5/10 health score)

---

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS

## QUESTIONS?

If stuck during execution:
1. Check QUICK_REFERENCE.md for commands
2. Check SESSION_5_PLAN.md troubleshooting section
3. Review test template and examples
4. Look at existing passing tests (classical_smc has 24 good examples!)
