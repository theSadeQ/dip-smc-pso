# Week 2 Future Work (Deferred)

**Source**: Moved from `.ai/planning/research/week2/` on October 18, 2025
**Status**: DEFERRED - Complete ROADMAP_EXISTING_PROJECT.md first

## Contents

This directory contains **Week 2 future research work** focused on implementing **new SMC controller types** that should be deferred until the existing project work is complete.

### Tasks: MT-1 and MT-2 (18 hours total)

**MT-1: Terminal Sliding Mode Control** (10 hours)
- Nonlinear sliding surface: `s = x + β·sign(x)|x|^α` (0 < α < 1)
- **Goal**: Finite-time convergence (30-50% faster than Classical SMC)
- **Deliverables**: `src/controllers/tsmc_smc.py`, tests, factory integration

**MT-2: Integral Sliding Mode Control** (8 hours)
- Integral sliding surface: `s = σ + ∫σ dt` (no reaching phase)
- **Goal**: 40-60% better disturbance rejection
- **Deliverables**: `src/controllers/ismc_smc.py`, tests, factory integration

## Why Deferred?

These are **NEW controllers** that should be implemented AFTER:
1. ✅ Existing 7 controllers validated and benchmarked (MT-5 in ROADMAP_EXISTING_PROJECT.md)
2. ✅ Lyapunov proofs for existing controllers complete (LT-4)
3. ✅ Current PSO performance baseline established (QW-3)
4. ✅ Chattering metrics operational (QW-4)
5. ✅ SMC theory documented for existing controllers (QW-1)

**Reason**: Cannot justify new controllers without first validating existing ones. Reviewers will ask "why not improve existing controllers first?"

**See**: `.ai/planning/futurework/ROADMAP_FUTURE_RESEARCH.md`, Section 1 (New Controllers)

## Integration Path (When Ready)

When you're ready to implement MT-1 and MT-2:

### Prerequisites
1. **Theory Foundation**: QW-1 complete (existing controllers documented)
2. **Benchmarking Framework**: MT-5 complete (performance comparison methodology)
3. **Testing Patterns**: All 7 existing controllers have ≥95% test coverage
4. **Factory Pattern**: Understand `src/controllers/factory.py` integration

### Implementation Order
1. **MT-1: Terminal SMC** (10 hours)
   - Theory & design (2h)
   - Implementation (4h)
   - Testing (2h)
   - Factory integration (1h)
   - Validation (1h)

2. **MT-2: Integral SMC** (8 hours)
   - Theory & design (1.5h)
   - Implementation (3.5h)
   - Testing (1.5h)
   - Factory integration (0.5h)
   - Validation (1h)

### Expected Outcomes
- 9 total controllers (7 existing + Terminal + Integral)
- Performance comparison: settling time, overshoot, energy, chattering
- Research paper updated with 2 new controller types

**Estimated Total Time**: 18 hours (as originally planned)
