# MT-2: Integral SMC Implementation Progress

**Total Effort**: 8 hours
**Status**: Not Started
**Current Subtask**: Awaiting MT-1 completion

---

## Subtask Checklist

### MT-2.1: Theory & Design (1.5h)
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Read docs/theory/smc_theory_complete.md (lines 326-400)
- [ ] Validate Integral SMC equations
- [ ] Design integral sliding surface: s = σ + ∫σ dt
- [ ] Design anti-windup mechanism
- [ ] Document design decisions

**Deliverable**: .ai/planning/research/week2/tasks/MT-2_DESIGN.md

---

### MT-2.2: Core Implementation (3.5h)
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create src/controllers/ismc_smc.py
- [ ] Implement class skeleton + __init__
- [ ] Implement _compute_sliding_surface(state, integral_state)
- [ ] Implement compute_control() with integral term
- [ ] Implement anti-windup logic (freeze integral during saturation)
- [ ] Implement utilities

**Deliverable**: src/controllers/ismc_smc.py (~280 lines)

---

### MT-2.3: Testing Suite (1.5h)
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create tests/test_controllers/test_ismc_smc.py
- [ ] Unit tests: initialization, s(0) = 0 (reaching phase elimination)
- [ ] Integration tests: control computation, anti-windup
- [ ] Performance tests: disturbance rejection vs classical SMC
- [ ] Run: pytest tests/test_controllers/test_ismc_smc.py -v

**Deliverable**: tests/test_controllers/test_ismc_smc.py (~200 lines), 8+ tests passing

---

### MT-2.4: Factory Integration (0.5h)
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Update src/controllers/factory.py
- [ ] Update config.yaml
- [ ] Test: create_controller('ismc_smc')

**Deliverable**: Factory integration complete

---

### MT-2.5: Validation & Documentation (1h)
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Run simulation with disturbance injection
- [ ] Measure disturbance rejection (verify 40-60% better)
- [ ] Verify no reaching phase (s(0) = 0)
- [ ] Update docs/theory/smc_theory_complete.md (line 326)
- [ ] Create .ai/planning/research/week2/tasks/MT-2_COMPLETION.md

**Deliverable**: Validated controller, updated documentation

## Quality Gate Status

- [ ] QG-6: Design validated
- [ ] QG-7: Implementation functional
- [ ] QG-8: Tests passing (s(0) = 0 verified)
- [ ] QG-9: Factory integration clean
- [ ] QG-10: Performance validated (40-60% better disturbance rejection)
