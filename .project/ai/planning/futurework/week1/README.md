# Week 1 Future Work (Deferred)

**Source**: Split from `.ai/planning/research/week1/` on October 18, 2025
**Status**: DEFERRED - Complete ROADMAP_EXISTING_PROJECT.md first

## Contents

This directory contains **Week 1 future research work** that should be deferred until the existing project work is complete.

### Task: MT-3 - Adaptive Inertia PSO

**Description**: Implement time-varying inertia weight for PSO optimizer
- **Effort**: 3 hours
- **Expected Gain**: 20-30% faster convergence
- **Current PSO**: Fixed inertia w = 0.729
- **Improvement**: `w(t) = w_max - (w_max - w_min) * t / T`

**Files**:
- `tasks/MT-3.md` - Task specification
- `results/adaptive_pso_log.txt` - Test results
- `results/pso_adaptive_inertia_comparison.md` - Analysis
- `results/run_adaptive_pso.py` - Test script

**Status**: Experimental work completed, but NOT integrated into main codebase

---

## Why Deferred?

This is a **new PSO algorithm** (adaptive inertia), which should be implemented AFTER:
1. ✅ Existing 7 controllers validated and benchmarked
2. ✅ Current PSO performance baseline established
3. ✅ Lyapunov proofs for existing controllers complete
4. ✅ Research paper on existing work drafted

**See**: `.ai/planning/futurework/ROADMAP_FUTURE_RESEARCH.md` for full future work plan

## Integration Path (When Ready)

When you're ready to implement MT-3:

1. **Verify Prerequisites**:
   - Existing PSO baseline established (QW-3 complete)
   - PSO optimizer has tests (`tests/test_optimizer/test_pso_optimizer.py`)

2. **Implementation**:
   - Modify `src/optimizer/pso_optimizer.py`
   - Add `adaptive_inertia` flag
   - Implement time-varying inertia

3. **Validation**:
   - Compare fixed vs adaptive on all 7 existing controllers
   - Verify 20-30% speedup claim

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update Tutorial 03 with adaptive PSO results

**Estimated Time**: 3 hours (as originally planned)
