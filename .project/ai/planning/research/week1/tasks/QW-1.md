# QW-1: Document Existing SMC Theory

**Effort**: 2 hours | **Priority**: High | **Blocks**: MT-1, MT-2 (Week 2)

## Quick Summary
Add mathematical formulations for 7 existing + 2 planned controllers to theory doc.

## Target
docs/theory/smc_theory_complete.md (~170 â†’ ~570 lines, +400 lines)

## Controllers to Document
1. Classical SMC (verify)
2. Super-Twisting (expand)
3. Adaptive SMC (complete)
4. Hybrid Adaptive STA-SMC (NEW)
5. Swing-Up SMC (NEW)
6. [PLAN] Terminal SMC (reference: Feng et al. 2002)
7. [PLAN] Integral SMC (reference: Utkin & Shi 1996)
8. [PLAN] Higher-Order SMC (reference: Levant 2003)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 7 existing controllers fully documented
- [ ] 2 planned controllers in PLAN sections
- [ ] LaTeX equations render correctly
- [ ] +400 lines added

See PLAN.md Task 2 for full details and formulations.
