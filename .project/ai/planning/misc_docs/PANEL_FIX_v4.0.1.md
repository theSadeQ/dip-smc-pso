# Network Downloader v4.0.1 - Panel Persistence Fix

## Problem

The panel was appearing on first load but then disappearing. This happened because:
1. Webpage was modifying the DOM after initial load
2. Our panel element was being removed by the page's code
3. No mechanism to detect and restore the panel

## Solution

### 1. MutationObserver Watcher

Added a `watchForRemoval()` method that monitors the DOM for changes:

```javascript
static watchForRemoval() {
    const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
        const panel = document.getElementById('speechify-downloader-panel');
        if (!panel && document.body) {
            console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Panel was removed, re-creating...');
            this.createPanel();
        }
    });

    observer.observe(document.body, {
        childList: true,
        subtree: false
    });
}
```

**What it does:**
- Watches for any child elements being removed from `<body>`
- If our panel (`#speechify-downloader-panel`) is missing, recreates it
- Automatically restores all captured files

### 2. File List Restoration

Added `refreshFileList()` to restore captured files when panel is recreated:

```javascript
static refreshFileList() {
    const files = audioStore.getAllFiles();
    if (files.length > 0) {
        files.forEach(fileInfo => {
            this.addFileToList(fileInfo, false); // Don't flash animation
        });
    }
}
```

**What it does:**
- Gets all files from storage
- Re-adds them to the new panel
- No flash animation (since they're not newly captured)

### 3. Duplicate Prevention

Added check to prevent duplicate files in UI:

```javascript
static addFileToList(fileInfo, flash = true) {
    // Check if file already in list
    const existing = this.fileList.querySelector(`[data-file-id="${fileInfo.id}"]`);
    if (existing) return;

    // ... rest of method
}
```

### 4. State Preservation

Panel remembers minimized/maximized state:

```javascript
static init() {
    this.isMinimized = false; // Track state
    // ...
}

static createPanel() {
    // Restore minimized state when recreating
    panel.innerHTML = `
        <div class="snd-body" style="${this.isMinimized ? 'display: none;' : ''}">
    `;

    // Set toggle button correctly
    toggle.textContent = this.isMinimized ? '+' : '‚àí';
}
```

## Changes from v4.0.0 to v4.0.1

| Feature | v4.0.0 | v4.0.1 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Panel persistence** | ‚ùå Disappears | ‚úÖ Auto-restores |
| **File preservation** | ‚ùå Lost | ‚úÖ Restored |
| **State memory** | ‚ùå Reset | ‚úÖ Preserved |
| **DOM watching** | ‚ùå None | ‚úÖ MutationObserver |

## Console Output

### Before Fix (v4.0.0)
```
‚úÖ Speechify Audio Network Downloader ready!
// Panel appears...
// (Panel disappears, no warning)
// User confused: "where did it go?"
```

### After Fix (v4.0.1)
```
‚úÖ Speechify Audio Network Downloader ready!
üîÑ Panel will automatically re-appear if removed by page
// Panel appears...
// (Page modifies DOM)
‚ö†Ô∏è Panel was removed, re-creating...
// Panel re-appears with all files intact!
```

## Testing

### How to Test the Fix

1. **Install v4.0.1**
2. **Open any webpage** (e.g., Medium.com)
3. **Verify panel appears** (purple panel, bottom-right)
4. **Capture some files** (play Speechify)
5. **Trigger DOM change:**
   - Navigate to different article
   - Use in-page navigation
   - Let page reload content dynamically
6. **Panel should:**
   - Reappear automatically if removed
   - Show all previously captured files
   - Maintain minimized/maximized state

### Expected Behavior

‚úÖ **Panel persists** - Stays visible or auto-restores
‚úÖ **Files preserved** - All captured files remain in list
‚úÖ **State maintained** - Minimized state remembered
‚úÖ **Console warnings** - Shows "Panel was removed, re-creating..." if needed

## How It Works (Timeline)

```
[Page Load]
‚Üì
Script installs network interceptors
‚Üì
Script creates panel
‚Üì
Script starts MutationObserver (watching for removal)
‚Üì
[User plays Speechify]
‚Üì
Files captured and shown in panel
‚Üì
[Page modifies DOM - removes our panel]
‚Üì
MutationObserver detects removal
‚Üì
Script recreates panel automatically
‚Üì
Script restores all captured files
‚Üì
Panel visible again with all data intact
```

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Body doesn't exist yet**
   - Script waits and retries
   - `setTimeout(() => this.createPanel(), 100)`

2. **Panel removed multiple times**
   - MutationObserver keeps watching
   - Recreates panel each time

3. **Files captured while panel removed**
   - Files stored in `audioStore` (separate from UI)
   - All files restored when panel recreated

4. **User minimizes panel before it's removed**
   - `isMinimized` state preserved
   - Panel recreated in minimized state

## Technical Details

### Why MutationObserver?

Other approaches considered:

‚ùå **Interval checking** (`setInterval`)
- Wasteful (checks every X ms)
- Delay before detecting removal
- More CPU usage

‚ùå **CSS position: fixed !important**
- Can't prevent JS removal
- Doesn't restore after removal

‚úÖ **MutationObserver** (chosen)
- Event-driven (no polling)
- Instant detection
- Low overhead
- Standard API

### Performance Impact

- **Memory:** Negligible (one observer instance)
- **CPU:** Minimal (only on DOM mutations)
- **Battery:** No measurable impact

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Panel still disappears

**Check:**
```javascript
// Open console
// Look for this message:
‚ö†Ô∏è Panel was removed, re-creating...

// If you DON'T see it:
// 1. Verify script version is 4.0.1
// 2. Check console for errors
// 3. Make sure Tampermonkey is enabled
```

### Issue: Files disappear when panel recreated

**Check:**
```javascript
// Files should be in audioStore:
console.log(audioStore.getAllFiles());
// Should show array of captured files

// If empty:
// Files were cleared (user clicked Clear All)
// Or never captured in first place
```

### Issue: Panel recreates too often

**Cause:** Page modifies DOM frequently

**Solution:** This is normal behavior
- Panel recreates as needed
- No performance impact
- Files always preserved

## Summary

**v4.0.1 fixes the "panel disappears" issue** with:
- ‚úÖ Automatic detection of removal
- ‚úÖ Instant restoration
- ‚úÖ File preservation
- ‚úÖ State memory
- ‚úÖ Zero user intervention needed

**User experience:**
- Panel "just works"
- No need to refresh page
- All captures preserved
- Seamless operation
