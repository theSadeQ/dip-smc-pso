# Phase 1: Foundations - Complete Beginner's Starting Point

**Target Audience**: Complete beginners with ZERO background in programming, control theory, or advanced mathematics

**Estimated Duration**: 40-50 hours over 6-8 weeks

**Prerequisites**: None - start from absolute basics

------

## Overview

Phase 1 builds the foundational knowledge required to understand and work with the double-inverted pendulum control system. This phase is structured into four parallel learning tracks that you can study concurrently or sequentially based on your learning style.

------

## Learning Tracks

### 1. Computing Basics (`computing-basics.md`)
**Time**: 10-12 hours

Learn how computers work, what programming is, and how to set up your development environment.

**Topics**:
- What is a computer program?
- Operating systems and file systems
- Command line basics (terminal/PowerShell)
- Installing Python and dependencies
- Text editors vs IDEs

### 2. Python Fundamentals (`python-fundamentals.md`)
**Time**: 15-18 hours

Master the Python programming language from scratch.

**Topics**:
- Variables, data types, operators
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Functions and modules
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries
- File I/O and error handling
- NumPy and SciPy basics

### 3. Physics Foundations (`physics-foundations.md`)
**Time**: 8-10 hours

Understand the physical principles behind the inverted pendulum system.

**Topics**:
- Newton's laws of motion
- Forces, torque, and angular motion
- Energy and momentum
- Friction and damping
- Coordinate systems and reference frames

### 4. Mathematics Essentials (`mathematics-essentials.md`)
**Time**: 10-12 hours

Build the mathematical toolkit needed for control systems.

**Topics**:
- Algebra review (equations, inequalities)
- Trigonometry (sin, cos, angles)
- Calculus basics (derivatives, integrals)
- Linear algebra (vectors, matrices)
- Differential equations (introduction)

## Learning Pathways

### Sequential Path (Recommended for Complete Beginners)
```
Week 1-2: Computing Basics → Python Fundamentals (basics)
Week 3-4: Python Fundamentals (advanced) → Physics Foundations
Week 5-6: Mathematics Essentials → Review and Practice
Week 7-8: Project Templates → Capstone Mini-Project
```

### Parallel Path (If You Have Some Background)
```
Study all four tracks concurrently:
- 2-3 hours/week on Computing + Python
- 1-2 hours/week on Physics
- 1-2 hours/week on Mathematics
- Weekly practice with examples and solutions
```

### Modular Path (Self-Paced)
```
Pick and choose based on your existing knowledge:
- Skip Computing Basics if you've programmed before
- Skip Physics if you have engineering background
- Skip Math if you've taken calculus/linear algebra
- Focus only on your knowledge gaps
```

## Success Criteria

You're ready for Phase 2 (Core Concepts) when you can:

1. **Computing/Python**:
   - Write a Python script that reads CSV data and plots results
   - Install packages with pip and manage virtual environments
   - Debug simple syntax and runtime errors

2. **Physics**:
   - Explain Newton's laws in your own words
   - Calculate torque and angular acceleration for a simple system
   - Understand the difference between position, velocity, and acceleration

3. **Mathematics**:
   - Solve basic differential equations by hand
   - Perform matrix operations (addition, multiplication, inversion)
   - Compute derivatives and integrals of simple functions

------

## How to Use This Phase 1 Folder

1. **Start with README.md** (this file) to get the big picture
2. **Read each learning track** in your preferred order
3. **Use cheatsheets** when you forget syntax or commands
4. **Run examples/** to see concepts in action
5. **Try exercises**, then check **solutions/** when stuck
6. **Build projects** using **project-templates/** to practice

------

## Time Management Tips

- **Consistent beats intensive**: 5 hours/week for 8 weeks > 20 hours in one week
- **Hands-on is essential**: Spend 60% of time coding, 40% reading
- **Take breaks**: Pomodoro technique (25 min work, 5 min break) works well
- **Don't get stuck**: If confused for >20 minutes, check solutions or ask for help

------

## What's Next?

After completing Phase 1, proceed to **Phase 2: Core Concepts** in `.ai/edu/beginner-roadmap.md`, which covers:
- Control theory fundamentals
- Sliding mode control basics
- State-space representation
- Stability analysis

Then advance to **Path 1: Quick Start** in `docs/guides/getting-started.md` to run your first simulation.
