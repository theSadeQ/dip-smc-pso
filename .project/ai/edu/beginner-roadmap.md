## Introduction

### What Is This Project About?

Imagine balancing a broomstick on your hand. Now imagine balancing TWO broomsticks stacked on top of each other, on a cart that can only move left and right. Impossible for humans without practice, right?

**This project teaches computers to do exactly that** - automatically, perfectly, every time.

### Why Should You Care?

This same technology is used in:

- **Bipedal robots** (humanoid robots that walk on two legs)
- **Rocket landing systems** (SpaceX Falcon 9 landing)
- **Satellite stabilization** (keeping satellites pointed in the right direction)
- **Self-balancing vehicles** (Segways, electric scooters)
- **Drone stabilization** (quadcopters staying level)
- **Industrial robotics** (robotic arms, manufacturing)

Learning this project gives you hands-on experience with:

- **Real control systems** used in industry
- **Programming in Python** (one of the most popular languages)
- **Scientific computing** (skills applicable to data science, AI, research)
- **Mathematical modeling** (understanding how to model physical systems)
- **Optimization algorithms** (finding best solutions automatically)

### What Makes This Hard?

Three challenges:

1. **Programming**: You need to learn Python from scratch
2. **Physics**: Understanding pendulums, forces, and motion
3. **Mathematics**: Control theory, differential equations, optimization

**Good news**: This roadmap breaks everything into digestible pieces.

### What You'll Be Able to Do

After completing this roadmap:

- **Run simulations** showing pendulums balancing themselves
- **Modify parameters** and see how behavior changes
- **Understand results** (graphs, metrics, performance)
- **Explain the system** to others (what it does and why)
- **Continue learning** through the advanced tutorials

---

## How to Use This Roadmap

### Time Commitment

**Realistic Schedule** (for working adults):

- **Intensive**: 10 hours/week → 12-15 weeks (3-4 months)
- **Moderate**: 6 hours/week → 20-25 weeks (5-6 months)
- **Casual**: 3 hours/week → 40-50 weeks (10-12 months)

**Don't rush!** Understanding is more important than speed.

### Learning Style

This roadmap supports multiple learning styles:

- **Visual learners**: Diagrams, videos, animations
- **Hands-on learners**: Experiments, interactive examples
- **Reading learners**: Detailed explanations, written resources
- **Auditory learners**: Video lectures, podcasts (linked)

### Checkpoints & Milestones

Each phase has:

- **Learning Objectives** (what you'll know)
- **Skills Assessment** (self-test your knowledge)
- **Achievement Badge** (celebrate progress!)
- **Estimated Time** (plan your schedule)

### When to Skip Sections

**You can skip sections if you already know**:

- Python basics? → Skip Phase 1.2 (Python Fundamentals)
- Physics background? → Skip Phase 1.4 (Basic Physics)
- Math degree? → Skim Phase 1.5 (Basic Math)

**Use the self-assessment quizzes** to decide what to skip.

---

## Learning Philosophy

### Progressive Complexity

We follow the **"crawl, walk, run"** approach:

1. **Crawl**: Understand concepts intuitively (no math)
2. **Walk**: See practical examples (light math)
3. **Run**: Dive into theory (full equations)

### Just-In-Time Learning

You learn concepts **right before you need them**, not months in advance.

Example:
- You learn "for loops" right before running batch simulations
- You learn "derivatives" right before understanding control laws

### Fail-Fast Feedback

Every section has:

- **Quick checks**: 2-3 questions to verify understanding
- **Immediate feedback**: Know if you got it right
- **Remediation**: Links to resources if you're stuck

### Spaced Repetition

Concepts repeat across phases with increasing depth:

- **Phase 1**: "A pendulum swings due to gravity"
- **Phase 2**: "Gravity creates a torque proportional to sin(θ)"
- **Phase 4**: "The gravitational torque term is mgl·sin(θ) in the Lagrangian"

---

## Phase 1: Foundations (Week 1-4, ~40 hours)

**Goal**: Build the absolute minimum knowledge to start programming and understand basic physics.

### Phase 1 Overview

1. **Variables and Data Types** (2 hours)
   - Numbers (integers, floats)
   - Strings (text)
   - Booleans (True/False)
   - Type conversion

   ```python
   # Variables store values
   age = 25
   name = "Alice"
   height = 1.75  # meters
   is_student = True

   # You can change variable values
   age = age + 1  # Now 26

   # Type conversion
   age_string = str(age)  # "26"
   number = int("42")     # 42
   ```

2. **Operators and Expressions** (1 hour)
   - Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` (power), `%` (modulo)
   - Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
   - Logical: `and`, `or`, `not`

   ```python
   # Arithmetic
   result = 10 + 5 * 2  # 20 (multiplication first)
   power = 2 ** 3       # 8 (2 to the power of 3)

   # Comparison
   is_adult = age >= 18  # True if age is 18 or more

   # Logical
   can_vote = (age >= 18) and (is_citizen)
   ```

3. **Control Flow: if/else** (2 hours)
   - Making decisions in code

   ```python
   age = 20

   if age >= 18:
       print("You are an adult")
   elif age >= 13:
       print("You are a teenager")
   else:
       print("You are a child")
   ```

4. **Loops: for and while** (2 hours)
   - Repeating actions

   ```python
   # For loop (repeat N times)
   for i in range(5):
       print(f"Count: {i}")  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

   # While loop (repeat until condition false)
   count = 0
   while count < 5:
       print(f"Count: {count}")
       count = count + 1
   ```

5. **Functions** (2 hours)
   - Reusable blocks of code

   ```python
   # Define a function
   def greet(name):
       return f"Hello, {name}!"

   # Call the function
   message = greet("Alice")
   print(message)  # "Hello, Alice!"

   # Function with multiple parameters
   def add_numbers(a, b):
       return a + b

   result = add_numbers(5, 3)  # 8
   ```

6. **Lists and Dictionaries** (1 hour)
   - Storing collections of data

   ```python
   # Lists (ordered)
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

   # Access by index (starts at 0)
   first_name = names[0]  # "Alice"

   # Add to list
   names.append("David")

   # Dictionaries (key-value pairs)
   person = {
       "name": "Alice",
       "age": 25,
       "city": "New York"
   }

   # Access by key
   person_age = person["age"]  # 25
   ```

**Practice Exercises**:

1. **Exercise 1**: Write a function that takes a temperature in Celsius and converts it to Fahrenheit.
   ```python
   def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
       # Formula: F = C * 9/5 + 32
       # Your code here
       pass
   ```

2. **Exercise 2**: Write a loop that prints all numbers from 1 to 10 that are even.

**Step 3: Working with Libraries (3 hours)**

**What is a library?**
- Pre-written code you can use
- Like using tools from a toolbox instead of making your own

**Essential Libraries for This Project**:

1. **NumPy** (Numerical computing)
   ```python
   import numpy as np

   # Create arrays (lists of numbers)
   numbers = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

   # Mathematical operations
   doubled = numbers * 2  # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
   mean = np.mean(numbers)  # 3.0
   ```

2. **Matplotlib** (Plotting)
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # Create a simple plot
   x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   y = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

   plt.plot(x, y)
   plt.xlabel("Time")
   plt.ylabel("Position")
   plt.title("My First Plot")
   plt.show()
   ```

**Practice Exercise**:
Create a plot showing the trajectory of a ball thrown upward:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Time from 0 to 2 seconds
time = np.linspace(0, 2, 100)

# Height equation: h = v0*t - 0.5*g*t^2
# v0 = initial velocity = 20 m/s
# g = gravity = 9.81 m/s^2
height = 20 * time - 0.5 * 9.81 * time**2

plt.plot(time, height)
plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
plt.ylabel("Height (m)")
plt.title("Ball Trajectory")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

---

**Step 4: Reading Error Messages (1 hour)**

**Why This Matters**:
- Errors are NORMAL - even experienced programmers see them constantly
- Error messages tell you what went wrong and where

**Common Error Types**:

1. **SyntaxError** (You made a typo):
   ```python
   # Missing colon
   if age >= 18
       print("Adult")
   # Error: SyntaxError: invalid syntax
   ```

2. **NameError** (Using undefined variable):
   ```python
   print(height)  # If 'height' was never defined
   # Error: NameError: name 'height' is not defined
   ```

3. **TypeError** (Wrong data type):
   ```python
   result = "5" + 5  # Can't add string and number
   # Error: TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
   ```

4. **IndexError** (List index out of range):
   ```python
   numbers = [1, 2, 3]
   print(numbers[5])  # Only indices 0, 1, 2 exist
   # Error: IndexError: list index out of range
   ```

**How to Debug**:
1. **Read the error message carefully** (last line tells you the error type)
2. **Look at the line number** (tells you where the error occurred)
3. **Check the error type** (gives you a clue about what's wrong)
4. **Google the error** ("Python NameError" will find explanations)

**Practice Exercise**:
Fix these buggy code snippets:

```python
# Bug 1
def calculate_area(length, width)
    return length * width

# Bug 2
ages = [25, 30, 35]
print(ages[3])

# Bug 3
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(name + age)
```

### Phase 1.4: Basic Physics Concepts (8 hours)

**Skip if**: You understand forces, torque, Newton's laws, and basic kinematics.

#### What You'll Learn

- What is a pendulum and why does it swing?
- Forces and Newton's laws
- Torque and rotational motion
- Energy (potential, kinetic)
- Why double pendulums are chaotic

#### Learning Path

**Step 1: Forces and Newton's Laws (2 hours)**

**Newton's First Law** (Inertia):
- An object at rest stays at rest
- An object in motion stays in motion
- Unless acted upon by a force

**Example**: A pendulum at rest won't start swinging unless you push it.

**Newton's Second Law** (F = ma):
- Force = Mass × Acceleration
- Heavier objects need more force to accelerate

**Example**:
- Cart mass = 1 kg
- To accelerate at 2 m/s², need force = 1 × 2 = 2 Newtons

**Newton's Third Law** (Action-Reaction):
- For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction

**Example**: When cart accelerates right, pendulum tilts left.

**Practice Exercise**:
1. If a cart has mass 2 kg and you apply 10 N force, what is the acceleration?
2. What happens to acceleration if you double the force?
3. What happens if you double the mass instead?

---

**Step 2: Understanding Pendulums (3 hours)**

**What is a Pendulum?**
- A mass suspended from a fixed point that can swing freely
- Examples: Grandfather clock, playground swing, chandelier

**Why Does It Swing?**

1. **Gravity pulls it down**
   - Creates a restoring force toward the equilibrium (hanging straight down)

2. **Inertia keeps it moving**
   - When passing through equilibrium, it has velocity
   - Continues past equilibrium due to inertia

3. **Energy conversion**
   - At highest point: Maximum potential energy, zero kinetic energy
   - At lowest point: Zero potential energy, maximum kinetic energy
   - Energy constantly converts between potential and kinetic

**Key Variables**:
- **θ (theta)**: Angle from vertical (0 = straight down)
- **L**: Length of pendulum
- **m**: Mass of pendulum bob
- **g**: Gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s²)

**Simple Pendulum Equation** (for small angles):
```
Period = 2π√(L/g)
```

**Example**:
- Length L = 1 meter
- Period = 2π√(1/9.81) ≈ 2 seconds (time for one complete swing)

**Interactive Demonstration**:

Try this online simulator:
- [PhET Pendulum Lab](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/pendulum-lab/latest/pendulum-lab_en.html)

**Practice Exercise**:
1. What happens to the period if you double the length?
2. What happens if you double the mass?
3. What happens if you increase the initial angle?

---

**Step 3: Double-Inverted Pendulum (2 hours)**

**What Makes It "Double"?**
- TWO pendulums connected in series
- First pendulum attached to cart
- Second pendulum attached to tip of first pendulum

**What Makes It "Inverted"?**
- Equilibrium is UPRIGHT (both vertical)
- NOT hanging down naturally
- Like balancing a broomstick on your hand

**Why Is This Hard?**

1. **Unstable Equilibrium**:
   - Upright position is unstable (like balancing a pencil on its point)
   - Any tiny disturbance causes it to fall
   - Requires constant correction

2. **Underactuated System**:
   - 1 input: Force on cart (left/right)
   - 3 degrees of freedom: Cart position, angle 1, angle 2
   - Can't directly control pendulum angles!

3. **Coupled Dynamics**:
   - Moving cart affects both pendulums
   - First pendulum motion affects second pendulum
   - Second pendulum motion affects first pendulum
   - Everything is interconnected

4. **Nonlinear Behavior**:
   - Small angle approximation (sin(θ) ≈ θ) doesn't work
   - Must use full nonlinear equations
   - Chaotic motion possible for large disturbances

**Analogy**:
Imagine balancing two broomsticks stacked end-to-end on a cart that you can only push left or right. That's the double-inverted pendulum challenge!

**Real-World Applications**:

- **Bipedal Robots**: Legs are like inverted pendulums
- **Rocket Landing**: Rocket body is inverted pendulum, thrust is control input
- **Human Standing**: Body segments as stacked pendulums, muscles provide control

**Visual Understanding**:

```
     🔴 ← m2 (second pendulum mass)
     |
     | L2 (second pendulum length)
     |
     🔵 ← m1 (first pendulum mass)
     |
     | L1 (first pendulum length)
     |
    [===] ← Cart (mass m0)
     |||
  =========== ← Track (cart moves left/right)
```

**State Variables** (what we need to track):
1. **x**: Cart position (meters)
2. **ẋ**: Cart velocity (meters/second)
3. **θ₁**: First pendulum angle from vertical (radians)
4. **θ̇₁**: First pendulum angular velocity (radians/second)
5. **θ₂**: Second pendulum angle from vertical (radians)
6. **θ̇₂**: Second pendulum angular velocity (radians/second)

**Practice Questions**:
1. Why can't we directly control the pendulum angles?
2. What happens if we push the cart to the right when both pendulums are tilting right?
3. Why is the upright position unstable?

---

**Step 4: Energy and Stability (1 hour)**

**Potential Energy** (PE):
- Energy due to position in gravitational field
- PE = mgh (mass × gravity × height)
- Higher = more potential energy

**Kinetic Energy** (KE):
- Energy due to motion
- KE = ½mv² (half × mass × velocity squared)
- Faster = more kinetic energy

**Energy in Pendulum**:

- **At top of swing**: Maximum PE, zero KE (stopped momentarily)
- **At bottom**: Zero PE (lowest point), maximum KE (fastest)
- **Total energy conserved** (ignoring friction)

**Stability**:

- **Stable Equilibrium**: Small disturbances decay back to equilibrium
  - Example: Pendulum hanging straight down
  - Ball at bottom of bowl

- **Unstable Equilibrium**: Small disturbances grow, system falls away
  - Example: Inverted pendulum (upright)
  - Ball balanced on top of hill

**Why Control is Needed**:
- Double-inverted pendulum is unstable equilibrium
- Without control, any tiny disturbance causes it to fall
- Controller must constantly make corrections to keep it upright

### Phase 1.5: Basic Math Concepts (5 hours)

**Skip if**: You're comfortable with functions, graphs, basic calculus (derivatives), and trigonometry.

#### What You'll Learn

- Functions and graphs
- Trigonometry (sin, cos, angles)
- Derivatives (rate of change)
- Basic differential equations (conceptual)

#### Learning Path

**Step 1: Functions and Graphs (1.5 hours)**

**What is a Function?**
- A relationship between input and output
- Example: f(x) = 2x (double the input)
- Input x=3 → Output f(3) = 6

**Graphing Functions**:
- x-axis: Input (independent variable)
- y-axis: Output (dependent variable)
- Plot shows how output changes with input

**Example: Pendulum Angle Over Time**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Time from 0 to 10 seconds
t = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)

# Angle as function of time (damped oscillation)
theta = 0.5 * np.exp(-0.1*t) * np.cos(2*np.pi*t)

plt.plot(t, theta)
plt.xlabel('Time (seconds)')
plt.ylabel('Angle (radians)')
plt.title('Pendulum Angle vs Time')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

**Key Function Types**:

1. **Linear**: y = mx + b (straight line)
2. **Quadratic**: y = ax² + bx + c (parabola)
3. **Exponential**: y = a·eᵇˣ (growth/decay)
4. **Trigonometric**: y = A·sin(ωx + φ) (oscillation)

**Practice Exercise**:
Plot these functions from x = 0 to 10:
1. y = 2x + 1
2. y = x²
3. y = sin(x)

---

**Step 2: Trigonometry Basics (1.5 hours)**

**Why Trigonometry?**
- Pendulum angles are measured in radians
- Sin and cos appear in pendulum equations
- Needed to understand rotational motion

**Key Concepts**:

**Angles**:
- **Degrees**: Full circle = 360°
- **Radians**: Full circle = 2π ≈ 6.28
- Conversion: radians = degrees × π/180

**Right Triangle**:
```
    |\
    | \  (hypotenuse)
  a |  \
    |   \
    |____\
      b
```

- sin(θ) = opposite/hypotenuse = a/c
- cos(θ) = adjacent/hypotenuse = b/c
- tan(θ) = opposite/adjacent = a/b

**Unit Circle**:
- Circle with radius 1
- Point on circle: (cos(θ), sin(θ))
- θ = 0: Point at (1, 0) → Right
- θ = π/2: Point at (0, 1) → Top
- θ = π: Point at (-1, 0) → Left

**Pendulum Connection**:
- Pendulum angle θ measured from vertical
- Horizontal position: L·sin(θ)
- Vertical position: L·cos(θ)

**Small Angle Approximation**:
- For small θ (< 0.1 rad ≈ 6°):
  - sin(θ) ≈ θ
  - cos(θ) ≈ 1
- This simplifies equations!
- **Inverted pendulum needs full equations** (large angles possible)

**Practice Exercise**:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Angles from 0 to 2π
theta = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)

# Plot sin and cos
plt.plot(theta, np.sin(theta), label='sin(θ)')
plt.plot(theta, np.cos(theta), label='cos(θ)')
plt.xlabel('θ (radians)')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.title('Sine and Cosine Functions')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Verify small angle approximation
small_angle = 0.1  # radians
print(f"θ = {small_angle}")
print(f"sin(θ) = {np.sin(small_angle):.4f}")
print(f"θ      = {small_angle:.4f}")
print(f"Difference: {abs(np.sin(small_angle) - small_angle):.6f}")
```

**Step 3: Derivatives (Rate of Change) (2 hours)**

**What is a Derivative?**
- Measures how fast something is changing
- Slope of a function at a point
- Example: Position → Velocity (rate of change of position)

**Notation**:
- dx/dt: Derivative of x with respect to t (velocity)
- dθ/dt or θ̇: Derivative of θ (angular velocity)
- d²x/dt² or ẍ: Second derivative (acceleration)

**Physical Meaning**:

| Quantity | Symbol | Derivative | Physical Meaning |
|----------|--------|------------|------------------|
| Position | x | dx/dt = v | Velocity |
| Velocity | v | dv/dt = a | Acceleration |
| Angle | θ | dθ/dt = ω | Angular velocity |
| Angular velocity | ω | dω/dt = α | Angular acceleration |

**Example: Falling Ball**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Time
t = np.linspace(0, 2, 100)

# Position (starts at 20m, falls with gravity)
h = 20 - 0.5 * 9.81 * t**2

# Velocity (derivative of position)
v = -9.81 * t

# Acceleration (derivative of velocity)
a = -9.81 * np.ones_like(t)

fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(3, 1, figsize=(8, 10))

ax1.plot(t, h)
ax1.set_ylabel('Height (m)')
ax1.set_title('Position vs Time')
ax1.grid(True)

ax2.plot(t, v)
ax2.set_ylabel('Velocity (m/s)')
ax2.set_title('Velocity (derivative of position)')
ax2.grid(True)

ax3.plot(t, a)
ax3.set_xlabel('Time (s)')
ax3.set_ylabel('Acceleration (m/s²)')
ax3.set_title('Acceleration (derivative of velocity)')
ax3.grid(True)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

**Derivatives in This Project**:

State vector includes both positions AND velocities:
```
[x, ẋ, θ₁, θ̇₁, θ₂, θ̇₂]
 ↑  ↑   ↑   ↑    ↑   ↑
 |  |   |   |    |   dθ₂/dt (second pendulum angular velocity)
 |  |   |   |    θ₂ (second pendulum angle)
 |  |   |   dθ₁/dt (first pendulum angular velocity)
 |  |   θ₁ (first pendulum angle)
 |  dx/dt (cart velocity)
 x (cart position)
```

**Differential Equations** (conceptual):
- Equations that relate quantities to their derivatives
- Example: Newton's 2nd Law: F = m·a = m·(dv/dt)
- Pendulum dynamics are differential equations
- Simulation "integrates" these equations to find motion over time

**You Don't Need to Calculate Derivatives by Hand**:
- The computer does it for you
- Just understand what they represent physically

### Phase 2.1: What is Control Theory? (6 hours)

**Goal**: Understand control theory through everyday examples before diving into technical details.

#### What You'll Learn

- Control systems are everywhere in daily life
- Open-loop vs closed-loop control
- Why feedback is essential
- Basic control terminology

#### Learning Path

**Step 1: Control Systems in Everyday Life (2 hours)**

**What is a Control System?**
- A system that manages and regulates another system's behavior
- Goal: Make something behave the way you want

**Examples You Use Every Day**:

1. **Thermostat** (Temperature Control)
   - **Goal**: Keep room at 70°F
   - **Sensor**: Thermometer measures current temperature
   - **Actuator**: Heater/AC adjusts temperature
   - **Controller**: Compares desired (70°F) vs actual, decides to heat or cool

2. **Cruise Control** (Speed Control)
   - **Goal**: Maintain 65 mph
   - **Sensor**: Speedometer measures current speed
   - **Actuator**: Engine throttle adjusts power
   - **Controller**: Increases/decreases throttle to maintain speed

3. **Shower Temperature** (Manual Control)
   - **Goal**: Comfortable water temperature
   - **Sensor**: Your hand feels the temperature
   - **Actuator**: Hot/cold water knobs
   - **Controller**: YOU (adjusting knobs based on feel)

**Common Pattern**:
1. **Desired state** (setpoint): What you want
2. **Actual state** (measurement): What you have
3. **Error**: Difference between desired and actual
4. **Control action**: Adjustment to reduce error

**Practice Exercise**:
Identify the components (goal, sensor, actuator, controller) for:
1. Autopilot in an airplane
2. Automatic lights that turn on at dusk
3. Self-parking car

---

**Step 2: Open-Loop vs Closed-Loop Control (2 hours)**

**Open-Loop Control** (No Feedback):
- Controller acts without measuring the result
- Like throwing a dart blindfolded

**Example**: Toaster
- You set timer to 2 minutes
- Toaster doesn't measure toast brownness
- If bread is frozen, it still stops after 2 minutes (might be undercooked)

**Pros**:
- Simple
- Cheap
- Fast

**Cons**:
- No correction for disturbances
- Sensitive to changes in environment
- No guarantee goal is achieved

---

**Closed-Loop Control** (With Feedback):
- Controller measures the result and adjusts
- Like throwing darts with your eyes open

**Example**: Thermostat
- Measures room temperature continuously
- Compares to desired temperature
- Adjusts heating/cooling based on error
- Even if door opens (disturbance), system compensates

**Pros**:
- Robust to disturbances
- Automatically corrects errors
- Achieves goal despite uncertainties

**Cons**:
- More complex
- Needs sensors
- Can be unstable if poorly designed

---

**The Feedback Loop**:

```
Desired    +     Error        Controller      Control       Plant        Actual
State   -----> (Compare) ---> (Decide)  ----> Action  ----> (System) ---> State
(Setpoint) -                                                               |
            |                                                              |
            +------------------ Feedback (Sensor) -------------------------+
```

**Double-Inverted Pendulum Example**:

- **Desired State**: Pendulums upright (θ₁ = 0, θ₂ = 0)
- **Actual State**: Measured angles (from sensors)
- **Error**: θ₁_error = 0 - θ₁_actual, θ₂_error = 0 - θ₂_actual
- **Controller**: Sliding mode control (calculates force needed)
- **Control Action**: Force applied to cart
- **Plant**: Physical pendulum system (responds to force)
- **Feedback**: Sensors measure new angles, repeat

**Practice Exercise**:
Draw the feedback loop diagram for:
1. Self-driving car maintaining lane position
2. Drone maintaining altitude

**Step 3: Control Theory Terminology (2 hours)**

**Essential Terms**:

1. **Setpoint** (Reference):
   - Desired value you want the system to achieve
   - Example: 70°F for thermostat

2. **Process Variable** (PV):
   - Actual measured value
   - Example: Current temperature

3. **Error** (e):
   - Difference: e = Setpoint - PV
   - Positive error: Need to increase
   - Negative error: Need to decrease

4. **Control Variable** (CV):
   - What the controller manipulates
   - Example: Heater power

5. **Disturbance**:
   - Uncontrolled input that affects system
   - Example: Opening a window (changes room temperature)

6. **Steady State**:
   - System has settled, not changing anymore
   - Error is minimal or zero

7. **Transient Response**:
   - System's behavior while changing from initial state to steady state
   - Includes overshoot, oscillations, settling time

8. **Stability**:
   - System eventually settles to steady state (doesn't diverge or oscillate forever)

**Performance Metrics**:

1. **Settling Time**:
   - How long to reach steady state
   - Faster is usually better

2. **Overshoot**:
   - How much the system exceeds the setpoint during transient
   - Lower is usually better (smoother)

3. **Steady-State Error**:
   - Error that remains after settling
   - Lower is better (more accurate)

4. **Rise Time**:
   - How quickly system initially responds
   - Faster is better (more responsive)

**Trade-offs**:
- Fast response often causes overshoot
- Eliminating overshoot makes response slower
- Controller design balances speed vs smoothness

**Practice Exercise**:
For each scenario, identify what needs to be minimized:

1. Autopilot: Plane should reach target altitude quickly without oscillating up and down.
   - Minimize: _____ (settling time, overshoot, or both?)

2. Robotic arm: Move precisely to pick up an egg without breaking it.
   - Minimize: _____ (overshoot, jerk, or both?)

3. Temperature control: Keep server room at exactly 68°F.
   - Minimize: _____ (steady-state error, disturbance rejection, or both?)

### Phase 2.2: Feedback Control Deep Dive (5 hours)

**Goal**: Understand how feedback control works mathematically (simple examples first).

#### Learning Path

**Step 1: PID Control (Intuitive Understanding) (3 hours)**

**Why PID?**
- Most common control algorithm in industry
- Simple but effective
- Foundation for understanding more advanced control

**PID = Proportional + Integral + Derivative**

---

**Proportional (P) Control**:
- Control action proportional to error
- Formula: `u = Kp × e`
- Kp = proportional gain (how aggressive)

**Example**: Steering a car to stay in lane
- If 1 meter off center (error = 1m):
  - Small Kp (0.5): Steer gently, slow correction
  - Large Kp (2.0): Steer hard, fast but jerky correction

**Problem with P-only**:
- Always leaves steady-state error
- Example: Heater can't quite reach 70°F, settles at 68°F

---

**Integral (I) Control**:
- Control action based on accumulated error over time
- Formula: `u = Ki × ∫e dt` (sum of all past errors)
- Eliminates steady-state error

**Example**: Filling a bathtub
- P-control alone might stop before completely full
- I-control remembers all past error, keeps adding water until full

**Problem with I-only**:
- Slow response
- Can cause overshoot (integrates too much error)

---

**Derivative (D) Control**:
- Control action based on rate of change of error
- Formula: `u = Kd × (de/dt)` (how fast error is changing)
- Provides damping (reduces overshoot)

**Example**: Braking a car
- See stop sign approaching:
  - P-control: Brake based on distance to stop
  - D-control: Brake harder if approaching fast, lighter if slowing down
  - Prevents overshoot (passing the stop line)

---

**PID Combined**:
```
u(t) = Kp·e(t) + Ki·∫e(t)dt + Kd·de(t)/dt
```

- **Kp**: How aggressively to respond to current error
- **Ki**: How much to correct accumulated past error
- **Kd**: How much to anticipate future error (damping)

**Tuning Trade-offs**:
- Increase Kp: Faster response, more overshoot
- Increase Ki: Eliminate steady-state error, slower, risk of overshoot
- Increase Kd: Reduce overshoot, smoother, sensitive to noise

**Interactive Demo**:

Try this PID simulator:
- [PID Simulator](http://www.pidlab.com/) or search "online PID simulator"

**Practice Exercise**:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def simulate_pid(setpoint, Kp, Ki, Kd, duration=10):
    """Simulate simple PID control."""
    dt = 0.01
    t = np.arange(0, duration, dt)

    # System state
    position = 0.0
    velocity = 0.0

    # PID variables
    integral = 0.0
    previous_error = 0.0

    # Logging
    positions = []
    control_inputs = []

    for _ in t:
        # Error
        error = setpoint - position

        # PID terms
        P = Kp * error
        integral += error * dt
        I = Ki * integral
        derivative = (error - previous_error) / dt
        D = Kd * derivative

        # Control input
        u = P + I + D

        # Simple system dynamics (position update)
        # Assume: acceleration = control input / mass (mass = 1)
        acceleration = u
        velocity += acceleration * dt
        position += velocity * dt

        # Logging
        positions.append(position)
        control_inputs.append(u)

        previous_error = error

    # Plot
    fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(10, 8))

    ax1.plot(t, positions, label='Position')
    ax1.axhline(y=setpoint, color='r', linestyle='--', label='Setpoint')
    ax1.set_ylabel('Position')
    ax1.set_title('PID Control Simulation')
    ax1.legend()
    ax1.grid(True)

    ax2.plot(t, control_inputs, label='Control Input')
    ax2.set_xlabel('Time (s)')
    ax2.set_ylabel('Control Input')
    ax2.legend()
    ax2.grid(True)

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

# Experiment with different gains
simulate_pid(setpoint=10, Kp=2.0, Ki=0.5, Kd=1.0)
```

Try different gains and observe:
1. Kp=10, Ki=0, Kd=0 (P-only)
2. Kp=10, Ki=2, Kd=0 (PI)
3. Kp=10, Ki=2, Kd=5 (PID)

**Step 2: Why PID Isn't Enough for DIP (2 hours)**

**PID Works Well For**:
- Linear systems (response proportional to input)
- Smooth, continuous dynamics
- Small disturbances
- Examples: Cruise control, temperature control, motor speed control

**Double-Inverted Pendulum Challenges**:

1. **Highly Nonlinear**:
   - Small angle: Easy (sin(θ) ≈ θ)
   - Large angle: Chaotic (sin(θ) ≠ θ)
   - PID assumes linearity

2. **Unstable Equilibrium**:
   - Any tiny error grows exponentially without control
   - PID response might be too slow

3. **Underactuated**:
   - 1 input (cart force)
   - 3 outputs (cart position, θ₁, θ₂)
   - Complex coupling

4. **Fast Dynamics**:
   - Pendulum falls quickly if not controlled
   - Requires aggressive control

**Need for Advanced Control**:
- Sliding Mode Control (SMC)
- Model Predictive Control (MPC)
- Adaptive Control
- Robust Control

**This Project Uses SMC** because:
- Handles nonlinearity well
- Fast response
- Robust to uncertainties
- Finite-time convergence guarantees

### Phase 2.3: Introduction to Sliding Mode Control (8 hours)

**Goal**: Understand what SMC is and why it works (intuitive, not mathematical proof yet).

#### Learning Path

**Step 1: The Sliding Surface Concept (3 hours)**

**Core Idea of SMC**:
1. Define a "sliding surface" in state space
2. Drive the system TO the surface
3. Keep the system ON the surface
4. On the surface, system converges to desired state

**Analogy**: Sliding Down a Hill

Imagine a ball on a hill:
- **Goal**: Get ball to bottom of valley (desired state)
- **Problem**: Ball could roll in any direction
- **Solution**: Create a chute (sliding surface)
  - First, push ball into the chute
  - Once in chute, gravity slides it to bottom automatically

**The Sliding Surface**:

For double-inverted pendulum:
```
s = k₁·θ₁ + k₂·θ̇₁ + λ₁·θ₂ + λ₂·θ̇₂
```

- **s**: Sliding surface value
- **s = 0**: System is ON the sliding surface
- **s ≠ 0**: System is OFF the surface (needs correction)

**What This Means**:
- Sliding surface combines position (θ) and velocity (θ̇) errors
- Specific combination defined by gains (k₁, k₂, λ₁, λ₂)
- When s=0, angles AND velocities are in proper relationship to converge

**Two-Phase Process**:

1. **Reaching Phase** (s ≠ 0):
   - System far from surface
   - Control law aggressively drives toward surface
   - Goal: Make s → 0

2. **Sliding Phase** (s = 0):
   - System on surface
   - Control maintains s ≈ 0
   - System "slides" along surface to equilibrium

**Visualization**:

```
         ↑
    θ̇ (Velocity)
         |
         |    s = 0 (Sliding Surface)
         |   /
         |  /
         | / ← System slides toward origin
         |/
    -----+--------→ θ (Angle)
         |
```

**Example Trajectory**:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulate SMC driving system to sliding surface
t = np.linspace(0, 5, 500)

# Angle (approaches zero)
theta = 0.5 * np.exp(-1.5*t) * np.cos(3*t)

# Angular velocity (derivative of theta)
dtheta = np.gradient(theta, t)

# Sliding surface (s = theta + 0.5*dtheta)
s = theta + 0.5*dtheta

fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(3, 1, figsize=(10, 10))

# Angle
ax1.plot(t, theta)
ax1.axhline(y=0, color='r', linestyle='--', label='Target')
ax1.set_ylabel('θ (rad)')
ax1.set_title('Pendulum Angle')
ax1.legend()
ax1.grid(True)

# Angular velocity
ax2.plot(t, dtheta)
ax2.axhline(y=0, color='r', linestyle='--', label='Target')
ax2.set_ylabel('dθ/dt (rad/s)')
ax2.set_title('Pendulum Angular Velocity')
ax2.legend()
ax2.grid(True)

# Sliding surface
ax3.plot(t, s)
ax3.axhline(y=0, color='g', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, label='Sliding Surface (s=0)')
ax3.fill_between(t, -0.05, 0.05, alpha=0.2, color='green', label='Sliding Region')
ax3.set_xlabel('Time (s)')
ax3.set_ylabel('s')
ax3.set_title('Sliding Surface Value')
ax3.legend()
ax3.grid(True)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

print("Notice how:")
print("1. Sliding surface (s) converges to zero first")
print("2. Once s ≈ 0, system slides to equilibrium (θ→0, dθ→0)")
```

**Practice Exercise**:
1. Why do we combine angle AND velocity in the sliding surface?
2. What happens if s > 0? What should control do?
3. What happens if s < 0? What should control do?

**Step 2: The Control Law (2 hours)**

**How to Drive to the Surface?**

**Ideal SMC Law** (Discontinuous):
```
u = -K · sign(s)
```

- If s > 0: u = -K (full force negative direction)
- If s < 0: u = +K (full force positive direction)
- If s = 0: Switch rapidly between ±K

**sign() Function**:
```
sign(x) = +1 if x > 0
sign(x) = -1 if x < 0
sign(x) =  0 if x = 0
```

**Why sign()?**
- Always pushes TOWARD the surface
- Maximum force when far from surface
- Guarantees finite-time convergence

**Problem: Chattering**

```
Control Signal with Pure Switching:
u
^
|  ___     ___     ___
| |   |   |   |   |   |
+-+---+---+---+---+---+---> time
|     |___|   |___|
|
```

- Rapid switching creates high-frequency oscillations
- Wears out actuators
- Causes noise and vibration
- Can excite unmodeled dynamics

**Solution: Boundary Layer**

**Smooth SMC Law** (Continuous):
```
u = -K · tanh(s / ε)
```

- ε (epsilon): Boundary layer width
- tanh: Smooth approximation to sign()
- When |s| > ε: Control ≈ ±K (full control)
- When |s| < ε: Control proportional to s (smooth)

**Tanh Function**:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

s = np.linspace(-2, 2, 1000)
epsilon_values = [0.1, 0.3, 1.0]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

for eps in epsilon_values:
    u = np.tanh(s / eps)
    plt.plot(s, u, label=f'ε = {eps}', linewidth=2)

# Compare with sign function
u_sign = np.sign(s)
plt.plot(s, u_sign, 'k--', label='sign(s)', linewidth=1.5, alpha=0.7)

plt.xlabel('Sliding Surface (s)', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Control (normalized)', fontsize=12)
plt.title('Boundary Layer Effect: tanh(s/ε)', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.axhline(y=0, color='gray', linestyle='--', alpha=0.5)
plt.axvline(x=0, color='gray', linestyle='--', alpha=0.5)
plt.show()
```

**Trade-off**:
- Smaller ε: Closer to ideal SMC, more chattering
- Larger ε: Smoother control, larger steady-state error

**Practice Exercise**:
1. Why does sign() cause chattering?
2. How does tanh() reduce chattering?
3. What happens if ε is very large (ε = 10)?

**Step 3: Why SMC Works for DIP (3 hours)**

**Advantages of SMC**:

1. **Robust to Uncertainties**:
   - Model mismatch? Still works!
   - Parameter variations? Compensates automatically!
   - Disturbances? Rejects effectively!

2. **Finite-Time Convergence**:
   - Reaches sliding surface in finite time (not just asymptotically)
   - Fast response

3. **Handles Nonlinearity**:
   - Doesn't assume system is linear
   - Works for large angle deviations

4. **Simple Implementation**:
   - Control law is algebraic (no integration needed)
   - Computationally efficient

**Why Perfect for Double-Inverted Pendulum**:

1. **Unstable System**:
   - SMC's aggressive initial response quickly stabilizes
   - Finite-time reaching prevents falling

2. **Nonlinear Dynamics**:
   - SMC doesn't require linearization
   - Works across full range of angles

3. **Model Uncertainty**:
   - Don't know exact friction? SMC compensates.
   - Parameter variations? SMC handles it.

4. **Disturbances**:
   - External pushes rejected automatically
   - Robust performance

**SMC Variants in This Project**:

1. **Classical SMC**:
   - Basic sliding mode with boundary layer
   - Good starting point

2. **Super-Twisting SMC (STA)**:
   - Second-order sliding mode
   - Continuous control (no chattering even without boundary layer!)
   - Smoother performance

3. **Adaptive SMC**:
   - Adapts gains online based on tracking error
   - Better for systems with large uncertainties

4. **Hybrid Adaptive STA-SMC**:
   - Combines adaptation with super-twisting
   - Best overall performance

**Visual Comparison**:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

t = np.linspace(0, 5, 500)

# Classical SMC response
theta_classical = 0.5 * np.exp(-1.2*t) * np.cos(3*t)

# STA-SMC response (smoother, faster)
theta_sta = 0.5 * np.exp(-1.5*t) * np.cos(3.5*t) * (1 - 0.2*np.exp(-2*t))

# Adaptive SMC response (slower initially, then fast)
theta_adaptive = 0.5 * np.exp(-t) * np.cos(2.5*t) * (1 + 0.5*np.exp(-3*t))

# Hybrid response (best)
theta_hybrid = 0.5 * np.exp(-1.8*t) * np.cos(4*t) * (1 - 0.1*np.exp(-2.5*t))

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(t, theta_classical, label='Classical SMC', linewidth=2)
plt.plot(t, theta_sta, label='Super-Twisting', linewidth=2)
plt.plot(t, theta_adaptive, label='Adaptive SMC', linewidth=2)
plt.plot(t, theta_hybrid, label='Hybrid Adaptive STA', linewidth=2)
plt.axhline(y=0, color='r', linestyle='--', alpha=0.5, label='Target')
plt.xlabel('Time (s)', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Pendulum Angle (rad)', fontsize=12)
plt.title('Comparison of SMC Variants', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.show()

print("Observations:")
print("- Classical: Good baseline, moderate oscillations")
print("- STA: Smoother, less chattering")
print("- Adaptive: Learns optimal gains over time")
print("- Hybrid: Best of both worlds")
```
