**Recommendations**:
1. **Add "Anti-Patterns to Avoid" section**:
   ```markdown
   ### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

   1. **Big-Bang Reorganization**
      - Problem: Attempting to reorganize entire docs/ in one commit
      - Impact: High risk of cascading failures, difficult to rollback
      - Better: Incremental, phase-by-phase approach

   2. **Manual Verification Only**
      - Problem: Relying on manual review for link checking
      - Impact: Missed 5 old path references (found by grep)
      - Better: Automated grep/Sphinx validation
   ```

2. **Add "Unexpected Findings" section**:
   ```markdown
   ### Unexpected Findings

   1. **File Type Assumption**
      - Expected: All directories have markdown files
      - Reality: 3 directories only had .bib, .py, .json files
      - Lesson: Always count ALL file types, not just markdown

   2. **Reference/ Already Well-Organized**
      - Expected: Major reorganization needed (344 files)
      - Reality: Only 7 root files needed moving (already had 18 subdirs)
      - Lesson: Trust Plan subagent analysis before assuming changes
   ```

3. **Add impact scoring for lessons**:
   ```
   | Lesson | Impact (1-10) | Evidence |
   |--------|---------------|----------|
   | Checkpoint-driven approach | 10 | Zero rollbacks needed, high confidence |
   | Sequential validation | 9 | Caught biblio warning early (Phase 3) |
   | Git mv preservation | 7 | 100% rename detection, helpful for archaeology |
   ```
