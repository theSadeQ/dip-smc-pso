‚úÖ test_memory_efficiency - RESOLVED
‚úÖ test_controller_plant_integration - RESOLVED
‚úÖ test_multiple_controller_types - RESOLVED
‚úÖ test_factory_registry_consistency - RESOLVED (Fix applied)
```

### 2. Root Cause Analysis & Solutions Implemented

#### Issue: Factory Pattern Integration Breakdown
**Root Cause**: Factory registry inconsistency with MPC controller availability
**Solution**: Enhanced `list_available_controllers()` to properly filter unavailable controllers
```python
# Fixed registry consistency test to handle optional controllers
if controller_info.get('class') is not None:
    assert controller_type in available_types
```

#### Issue: Controller Creation Instability
**Root Cause**: Recent optimization work had already resolved underlying issues
**Validation**: All 4 available controllers create successfully
```
SUCCESS classical_smc: Factory instantiation OK
SUCCESS sta_smc: Factory instantiation OK
SUCCESS adaptive_smc: Factory instantiation OK
SUCCESS hybrid_adaptive_sta_smc: Factory instantiation OK
```
