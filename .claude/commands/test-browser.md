# Streamlit Dashboard Testing

I'll use the Puppeteer server to test your Streamlit dashboard.

## Available Tests

### 1. **Visual Testing**
- Screenshot dashboard pages
- Verify plot rendering (matplotlib animations)
- Capture simulation results
- UI state validation

### 2. **Functional Testing**
- Controller selection widgets
- Parameter input forms
- PSO optimization triggers
- Simulation execution
- Configuration loading

### 3. **Performance Testing**
- Dashboard load time
- Simulation execution speed
- Plot rendering performance
- Real-time update monitoring

### 4. **Integration Testing**
- End-to-end simulation workflows
- PSO optimization → results visualization
- Controller comparison flows
- Configuration → simulation → analysis

## What would you like to test?

### Common Requests for DIP-SMC-PSO:

**Screenshot**:
- "Screenshot Streamlit dashboard at localhost:8501"
- "Capture simulation results page"

**Simulation Flow**:
- "Test classical SMC simulation with default gains"
- "Verify PSO optimization workflow completes"

**Controller Testing**:
- "Test all 4 controller types render correctly"
- "Verify controller selection updates parameters"

**Performance**:
- "Measure dashboard load time"
- "Monitor simulation execution time"

**Visualization**:
- "Verify all plots render without errors"
- "Screenshot controller comparison results"

Please describe what you'd like to test, including:
- URL (default: localhost:8501 for Streamlit)
- Specific simulation or workflow
- What to verify
