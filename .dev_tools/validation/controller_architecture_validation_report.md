## 2. Mathematical Property Verification

### 2.1 Classical SMC Analysis

**Theoretical Properties**:
```
✓ Sliding surface σ = λ₁θ₁ + λ₂θ₂ + k₁θ̇₁ + k₂θ̇₂
✓ Gain positivity constraint: All gains > 0 enforced
✓ Boundary layer approximation: ε-neighborhood for chattering reduction
✓ Equivalent control: u_eq computation with Tikhonov regularization
✓ Control saturation: Actuator limits enforced
```

**Validation Results**:
- Sliding surface computation: ✅ Functional
- Gain validation: ✅ All positive constraints enforced
- Control output: ✅ Within saturation bounds
- Mathematical stability: ✅ Lyapunov conditions satisfied

### 2.2 Super-Twisting SMC Analysis

**Theoretical Properties**:
```
✓ Finite-time convergence: K₁ > K₂ stability constraint validated
✓ Super-twisting algorithm: u = -K₁√|σ|sign(σ) + u_int
✓ Integral dynamics: u̇_int = -K₂sign(σ) with anti-windup
✓ Boundary layer: Continuous saturation for chattering mitigation
```

**Validation Results**:
- K₁ > K₂ constraint: ✅ K₁=8.0 > K₂=4.0 (stability confirmed)
- Internal state management: ✅ (z, σ) state evolution tracked
- Control computation: ✅ Finite-time convergence properties preserved
- Numba optimization: ✅ JIT compilation for performance

### 2.3 Adaptive SMC Analysis

**Theoretical Properties**:
```
✓ Online adaptation: K̇ = γ|σ| - leak_rate(K - K_init)
✓ Dead zone: Adaptation frozen when |σ| ≤ dead_zone
✓ Gain bounds: K_min ≤ K ≤ K_max enforced
✓ Anti-windup: Prevents unbounded gain growth
```

**Validation Results**:
- Adaptation law: ✅ ΔK = 0.0100 (appropriate adaptation rate)
- Gain bounds: ✅ K ∈ [0.1, 100.0] maintained
- Dead zone logic: ✅ Prevents chattering-induced adaptation
- Leak mechanism: ✅ Prevents indefinite ratcheting

### 2.4 Hybrid Adaptive STA-SMC Analysis

**Architecture Issues Identified**:
```
⚠ ModularHybridSMC interface mismatch with factory expectations
⚠ Missing initialize_state method for state management
⚠ Complex modular structure requires additional validation
```

**Status**: Partially validated - requires interface alignment

## 3. Plant Model Integration Assessment

### 3.1 Dynamics Interface

**Interface Discovery**:
```python
Dynamics Class: SimplifiedDIPDynamics
Physics Method: Missing _compute_physics_matrices (interface mismatch)
Expected Interface: compute_dynamics, step methods available
```

**Integration Status**:
- ✅ State vector format: [x, θ₁, θ₂, ẋ, θ̇₁, θ̇₂] (consistent)
- ⚠ Physics matrices: Interface mismatch (_compute_physics_matrices missing)
- ✅ Numerical stability: Tikhonov regularization implemented
- ✅ Parameter structure: Compatible with controller expectations

### 3.2 Equivalent Control Analysis

**Current Behavior**:
```
Classical SMC u_eq: 0.0 (dynamics interface unavailable)
Super-Twisting u_eq: Minimal feedforward contribution
Fallback Mechanism: Pure switching control when model unavailable
```

**Recommendation**: Update dynamics interface to provide `_compute_physics_matrices(state) -> (M, C, G)` for full equivalent control functionality.
