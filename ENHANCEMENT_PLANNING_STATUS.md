## Next Steps: GET APPROVAL

### Questions for User (Please Answer)

1. **Scope** - Is 4-level framework appropriate?
   - Level 1 (Foundation): Measurement, logging, fault injection, monitoring, baselines
   - Level 2 (Enhancement): New controllers, robustness, uncertainty quantification, visualization
   - Level 3 (Innovation): Learning-based controllers, neural networks, digital twin
   - Level 4 (Production): Full hardening, optimization, deployment

2. **Timeline** - Can you allocate time?
   - Level 1: 5 weeks (40-50 hours)
   - Level 2: 7 weeks (50-65 hours)
   - Level 3: 5 weeks (40-50 hours)
   - Level 4: 4 weeks (30-40 hours)
   - **Total**: 20 weeks (5 months), ~1-2 hours/day

3. **Parallel Execution** - OK to run multiple agents?
   - Level 1: 5 agents in parallel (recommended)
   - Each agent handles one phase
   - Automatic checkpoint synchronization

4. **Token Limit Recovery** - How critical?
   - Checkpoint system saves progress every 5 minutes
   - `/recover` command shows status
   - `/resume` continues from last checkpoint
   - This is CRITICAL for multi-week projects

5. **Success Criteria** - Are 6 metrics sufficient for Level 1?
   - Measurement infrastructure ✓
   - Logging integrated ✓
   - Fault injection tests ✓
   - Monitoring dashboard ✓
   - Baselines established ✓
   - Documentation complete ✓

6. **Future Levels** - Interested after Level 1?
   - Level 2: More controllers + advanced features
   - Level 3: AI/ML integration
   - Level 4: Production hardening

## How to Launch (After Approval)

### Step 1: Review & Approve
Read the summary and answer the 6 questions.

### Step 2: Confirm Approach
Confirm OK to:
- Run 5 agents in parallel for Level 1
- Use checkpoint system (every 5 minutes auto-save)
- Allocate 5 weeks for Level 1
- Follow the 6 success metrics

### Step 3: Launch
```bash
# Manual launch (after approval):
python -m task_wrapper start L1P1_MEASUREMENT agent1_measurement --checkpoint

# Then launch agents 2-5 for parallel execution
python -m task_wrapper start L1P2_LOGGING agent2_logging --checkpoint
python -m task_wrapper start L1P3_FAULT_INJECTION agent3_faults --checkpoint
python -m task_wrapper start L1P4_MONITORING agent4_monitoring --checkpoint
python -m task_wrapper start L1P5_BASELINES agent5_baselines --checkpoint
```

### Step 4: Monitor Progress
```bash
# Check status anytime:
/recover
# Shows: "Level 1 progress: 2/5 phases complete, 15/40 hours done"

# View detailed progress:
python .project/dev_tools/roadmap_tracker.py

# Resume after token limit:
/resume L1P1_MEASUREMENT agent1_measurement
```

## Why This Plan is Different

### Traditional Approach
```
Week 1: Run tests
Week 2: Add logging
Week 3: Implement monitoring
Week 4: Run baselines
= 4 weeks, sequential, slow
```

### This Plan
```
Week 1: Phase 1.1 (Measurement) - foundation
Week 2-5: Phases 1.2-1.5 in parallel (4 agents)
= 5 weeks, but faster total delivery
+ Checkpoint system handles interruptions
+ Clear success criteria (6 metrics)
+ Foundation for Levels 2-4
```

## Current Project Baseline

| Metric | Current | After Level 1 (Target) |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Coverage Measurement | Broken | ✅ Working |
| Logging | Minimal | ✅ Comprehensive |
| Fault Testing | None | ✅ Framework complete |
| Monitoring | None | ✅ Dashboard live |
| Baselines | None | ✅ Established (7 controllers) |
| Production Readiness | 63.3/100 | 75-80/100 (estimated) |

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| pytest Unicode unresolved | Low | High | Solution from CA-02 known |
| Phase dependencies | Low | Low | Phases can run independently |
| Time estimates exceed | Medium | Medium | 40-50 hr range has 20% buffer |
| Token limit hit | Medium | Low | Checkpoint system handles it |

**Overall Risk Assessment**: LOW (Well-mitigated)
