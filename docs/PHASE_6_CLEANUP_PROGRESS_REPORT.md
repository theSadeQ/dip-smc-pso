|--------|-------|-------------|
| `a7537fd` | 1 file | Fixed 9 broken links in week_3_optimization_simulation.md |
| `00c8410` | 6 files | Fixed 8 broken links in hil-workflow.md + 5 stub files |

**Total Files Changed:** 16 documentation files + 9 new stub files = 25 files --- ## Remaining Work ### To Reach Original Goal (<20 Broken Links) **Broken Links to Fix:** 87 more links
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours
**Priority Areas:**
1. Configuration documentation (placeholder links)
2. PSO report files (validation reports with example links)
3. API reference path corrections
4. Mathematical foundations cross-references ### Optional Enhancements **Task:** Tag 299 conceptual code examples with metadata
**Estimated Time:** 1 hour
**Benefits:** Improved example categorization, better search discoverability **Task:** Create missing API stub files
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes
**Benefits:** Reduce broken link count by ~15 links --- ## Lessons Learned ### What Worked Well
1. **Systematic Approach:** Fixing broken links by file (not by link type) was efficient
2. **Stub File Strategy:** Creating stubs solved multiple broken links simultaneously
3. **Redirection First:** Checking for existing documentation before creating stubs avoided duplication
4. **Batch Commits:** Grouping related fixes into logical commits improved git history clarity ### Challenges Encountered
1. **Cached Database:** Original `broken_links.json` was outdated (162 vs actual count)
2. **Directory Depth:** Many broken links were simple `../` vs `../../` path issues
3. **Orphaned Documents:** Some "orphaned" docs were actually well-linked (false positives) ### Process Improvements
1. Regenerate cross-reference database **before** starting cleanup for accurate baseline
2. Use pattern matching to batch-fix similar path errors across multiple files
3. Create validation scripts to detect common broken link patterns (e.g., relative path depth) --- ## Recommendations ### Immediate Next Steps (Priority 1)
1. **Complete Broken Link Reduction:** - Target: Fix remaining 87 links to reach <20 threshold - Focus: Configuration docs, PSO reports, API references - Estimated time: 4-5 hours 2. **Push All Changes:** - Current status: 5 commits ready to push - Command: `git push origin main` ### Medium-Term Improvements (Priority 2)
1. **Automated Link Validation:** - Integrate `pytest tests/test_documentation/test_cross_references.py` into CI/CD - Prevent new broken links from being introduced 2. **Stub File Completion:** - Complete 3-5 highest-priority stub files - Target: HIL safety validation, custom cost functions, PSO adaptive SMC ### Long-Term Enhancements (Priority 3)
1. **Documentation Index Enhancement:** - Add workflow guide section to main INDEX.md - Create sitemap for all 744 documents 2. **Cross-Reference Density Improvement:** - Current: 1.72 links/document - Target: 3.0 links/document - Strategy: Add "See Also" sections to isolated documents --- ## Success Criteria Assessment | Criterion | Target | Achieved | Status |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| Broken Links Fixed | 114 links | 55 links | ðŸŸ¡ 48% |
| Broken Link Rate | <2% (20 links) | 8.4% (107 links) | ðŸŸ¡ Partial |
