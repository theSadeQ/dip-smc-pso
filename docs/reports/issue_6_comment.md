# 🏗️ HIGH Priority Resolution Plan — Issue #6: Controller Factory Integration Breakdown ## 0) Definition of Done — **Factory Pattern Success Criteria** * [ ] **Factory Integration Test Success Rate 100%:** Achieve 12/12 factory integration tests passing (currently 0/12 = 0%)

* [ ] **Multi-Controller Type Support:** Reliable creation and instantiation of all controller variants (Classical SMC, STA, Adaptive, Hybrid, MPC, Swing-up)
* [ ] **Registry Unification:** Single source of truth for controller discovery and type mapping
* [ ] **Interface Standardization:** Uniform `compute_control` method signature across all controllers
* [ ] **Configuration Robustness:** Tolerant handling of dict/object configs with proper defaults and validation
* [ ] **Performance Analysis Framework:** Functional controller comparison and benchmarking features * [ ] **Error Handling & Recovery:** Graceful degradation and meaningful error messages for factory failures
* [ ] **Integration Layer Stability:** Plant-controller binding and dynamics resolution operational

## 1) IMMEDIATE FACTORY CONTAINMENT (Deploy First - Within 8 Hours) **CRITICAL:** These actions must be implemented immediately to prevent further architectural degradation: * [ ] **Registry Unification:** Freeze single public surface in package façade, eliminate parallel implementations *(Priority: **CRITICAL/4H**)*

* [ ] **Deprecation Mapping Hot-patch:** Replace exported function with backward-compatible 3-arg signature *(Priority: **CRITICAL/2H**)*
* [ ] **Controller Interface Adapter:** Wrap all controllers with canonical `compute_control` method adapter *(Priority: **CRITICAL/6H**)*

---

## 2) Priority-Ranked Factory Diagnostic Checklist (run in architectural dependency order) **Goal:** Systematic root cause isolation of factory failures by *(A) registry, (B) interface, (C) configuration, (D) dynamics, (E) integration*. 1. **Registry & Public Surface Validation** * [ ] Verify single `CONTROLLER_REGISTRY` in `src/controllers/factory.py` with no duplicates * [ ] Check package `__init__.py` exports from single source, no fallback registries * [ ] Validate all controller types pre-registered with metadata (class, config, defaults) * **Fail rule:** Multiple registries or empty fallback discovered → **Primary: Registry Fragmentation** 2. **Interface Contract Conformance** * [ ] Verify uniform `compute_control(state, state_vars, history)` signature across all controllers * [ ] Check adapter wrapping for legacy two-arg call patterns * [ ] Validate return value normalization (`{'u': float}` or scalar) * **Fail rule:** Interface signature mismatches or adapter failures → **Primary: Interface Drift** 3. **Configuration & Defaults Handling** * [ ] Test dict/object config tolerance with proper fallbacks * [ ] Verify `_as_dict`, `_get_default_gains` co-location in new factory * [ ] Check deprecation mapping for controller names and parameter keys * **Fail rule:** Config shape errors or missing defaults → **Primary: Configuration Fragility** 4. **Dynamics Resolution & Import Stability** * [ ] Validate centralized `_build_dynamics` in factory module * [ ] Test dynamics import fallbacks and constructor arguments * [ ] Check module path resolution and error handling * **Fail rule:** Dynamics instantiation failures or import errors → **Primary: Dynamics Integration** 5. **Multi-Controller Integration & Performance** * [ ] Test reliable controller type switching and comparison frameworks * [ ] Verify memory efficiency and resource management * [ ] Validate performance analysis and benchmarking features * **Fail rule:** Multi-controller operations fail or resource leaks → **Primary: Integration Layer** > **Execute in architectural dependency order and stop at first failure;** document primary factory cause.

## 3) Critical Factory Fixes (Immediate Implementation) 1. **Registry Unification & Public API Consolidation** * [ ] Eliminate parallel factory implementations and registry duplicates * [ ] Consolidate all public exports in single source with package façade pattern * [ ] Implement canonical controller name mapping with deprecation support *(T-shirt: **M**, Priority: **CRITICAL**)* 2. **Interface Standardization & Adapter Implementation** * [ ] Create controller adapter for uniform `compute_control` method signature * [ ] Implement return value normalization across all controller types * [ ] Fix controller interface drift with backward-compatible wrappers *(T-shirt: **S**, Priority: **CRITICAL**)* 3. **Configuration Robustness & Dynamics Integration** * [ ] Co-locate configuration adapters and default handling in factory * [ ] Implement centralized dynamics resolver with proper error handling * [ ] Fix config shape ambiguity and import fragility issues *(T-shirt: **M**, Priority: **CRITICAL**)*

## 4) Risk Mitigation Priorities (Systematic Factory Improvements) 1. **Factory Pattern Architecture Hardening** * [ ] Implement contract tests for public API smoke testing (import time < 5s) * [ ] Add factory tolerance testing for invalid configs with graceful fallbacks * [ ] Create interface conformance validation for all registered controllers * [ ] Deploy deterministic import handling with clear error messages *(T-shirt: **L**, Priority: **HIGH**)*
