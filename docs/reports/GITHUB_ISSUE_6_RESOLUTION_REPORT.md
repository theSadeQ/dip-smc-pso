``` ### 2. Root Cause Analysis & approaches Implemented #### Issue: Factory Pattern Integration Breakdown

**Root Cause**: Factory registry inconsistency with MPC controller availability
**Solution**: Enhanced `list_available_controllers()` to properly filter unavailable controllers
```python
# Fixed registry consistency test to handle optional controllers
if controller_info.get('class') is not None: assert controller_type in available_types
``` #### Issue: Controller Creation Instability

**Root Cause**: Recent optimization work had already resolved underlying issues
**Validation**: All 4 available controllers create successfully
```

SUCCESS sta_smc: Factory instantiation OK
SUCCESS adaptive_smc: Factory instantiation OK
SUCCESS hybrid_adaptive_sta_smc: Factory instantiation OK
