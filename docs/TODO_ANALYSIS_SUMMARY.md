## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Markers

**Marker #1: Coverage Baseline**
- **Risk:** May reveal significant gaps requiring 100+ hours of test development
- **Mitigation:** Accept phased improvement, prioritize safety-critical components first
- **Contingency:** Set realistic 60% coverage target for Phase 1, 85% for Phase 2

**Marker #13: Chattering Validation**
- **Risk:** Validation may fail, requiring PSO re-optimization with corrected fitness
- **Mitigation:** Corrected PSO scripts already prepared (`optimize_chattering_focused.py`)
- **Contingency:** Allocate 2-3x time for potential re-runs (12h instead of 4h)

**Marker #27: PSO Empirical Validation**
- **Risk:** Empirical results may not match theoretical predictions
- **Mitigation:** Document gaps transparently, iterate on PSO configuration
- **Contingency:** Accept partial validation, prioritize simulation-based optimization

### Blocking Dependencies

**Blocker 1: PSO Completion**
- **Blocks:** Markers 11, 12 → 13, 14 (Issue #12 closure)
- **Status:** PSO running for adaptive_smc and sta_smc
- **ETA:** 2-4 hours per controller
- **Action:** Monitor PSO logs, prepare validation scripts in parallel

**Blocker 2: Coverage Baseline**
- **Blocks:** Markers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (all component-level analysis)
- **Status:** Not started
- **ETA:** 8 hours for initial run
- **Action:** Schedule immediately, allocate dedicated time

**Blocker 3: Week 3 Documentation Completion**
- **Blocks:** Markers 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 (weeks 4-8 scheduling)
- **Status:** Week 3 in progress (planned)
- **ETA:** 2025-10-24 (per README.md)
- **Action:** Track Week 3 progress, prepare Week 4 kickoff

   # Wait for PSO completion, then:
   python scripts/optimization/validate_and_summarize.py
   ```
   - Updates markers 11, 12, 13, 14
   - Enables Issue #12 closure with evidence

3. **Execute Quick Wins (P1-P2, 1.6h)**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v --tb=short > test_summary.txt
   time pytest tests/
   find src/ -name '*.py' -exec du -ch {} + | tail -1
   ```
   - Updates markers 9, 10, 23

### Monthly Priorities (4 Weeks)

**Week 1:** Coverage baseline + Issue #12 (46h)
**Week 2:** Component analysis + quick wins (22.75h)
**Week 3:** Integration tests + PSO validation (12.75h)
**Week 4:** Documentation planning + wrap-up (11.1h)

**Total Effort:** 92.6 hours over 4 weeks (23.15h/week average)

### Long-Term Strategy (Beyond 4 Weeks)

**Remaining P2/P3 Markers:** 97 markers, ~191.9 hours

**Suggested Phasing:**
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** P0/P1 markers (80% completion target)
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):** P2 markers (documentation planning, AST validation)
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):** P3 markers (placeholders, nice-to-haves)

**Continuous Improvement:**
- Weekly TODO review and reprioritization
- Automated marker extraction from new documentation
- Integration with CI/CD for validation automation
