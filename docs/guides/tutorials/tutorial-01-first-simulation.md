## Background: The Double-Inverted Pendulum ### System Description The double-inverted pendulum (DIP) is a classic benchmark problem in control theory. It consists of: **Physical Components:**

- **Cart:** Moves horizontally on a frictionless track
- **First Pendulum:** Attached to cart, free to rotate
- **Second Pendulum:** Attached to tip of first pendulum
- **Actuator:** Applies horizontal force to cart **Control Objective:**
Stabilize both pendulums in the upright position (vertical) while regulating the cart's position, using only horizontal force on the cart. **Why is this challenging?** 1. **Underactuated System:** One control input (cart force) but three degrees of freedom (cart position + 2 pendulum angles)
2. **Unstable Equilibrium:** Upright position is naturally unstable (like balancing a broomstick on your hand)
3. **Nonlinear Dynamics:** Equations of motion include sin/cos terms and coupling effects
4. **Coupled Motion:** Moving the cart affects both pendulums; pendulum motion affects cart ### State Variables The system is described by 6 state variables: ```python
state = [x, dx, θ₁, dθ₁, θ₂, dθ₂]
``` | Variable | Description | Units | Typical Range |
|----------|-------------|-------|---------------|
| `x` | Cart position | m | ±2.0 |
| `dx` | Cart velocity | m/s | ±3.0 |
| `θ₁` | First pendulum angle from vertical | rad | ±π |
| `dθ₁` | First pendulum angular velocity | rad/s | ±10 |
| `θ₂` | Second pendulum angle from vertical | rad | ±π |
| `dθ₂` | Second pendulum angular velocity | rad/s | ±10 | **Sign Conventions:**
- Positive `x`: Cart to the right
- Positive `θ₁`, `θ₂`: Pendulums tilted to the right (clockwise from vertical)
- Vertical upright: `θ₁ = θ₂ = 0` ### Physical Parameters The default configuration uses realistic parameters: ```yaml
# config.yaml - dip_params section
m0: 1.0 # Cart mass (kg)
m1: 0.1 # First pendulum mass (kg)
m2: 0.1 # Second pendulum mass (kg)
l1: 0.5 # First pendulum length (m)
l2: 0.5 # Second pendulum length (m)
I1: 0.0083 # First pendulum inertia (kg·m²)
I2: 0.0083 # Second pendulum inertia (kg·m²)
g: 9.81 # Gravitational acceleration (m/s²)
``` **Total Height:** 1.0 m (both pendulums vertical)

**Total Mass:** 1.2 kg (cart + both pendulums) ### Classical SMC Overview Sliding Mode Control (SMC) is a nonlinear control technique that: 1. **Defines a Sliding Surface:** A function of state errors ``` s = k₁·θ₁ + k₂·dθ₁ + λ₁·θ₂ + λ₂·dθ₂ ``` 2. **Drives System to Surface:** Control law forces `s → 0` ``` u = -K·sign(s) or u = -K·tanh(s/ε) (smoothed) ``` 3. **Maintains on Surface:** Once on surface, system slides to equilibrium **Key Properties:**
- **Robustness:** Insensitive to model uncertainties and disturbances
- **Finite-Time Convergence:** Reaches sliding surface in finite time
- **Chattering:** High-frequency switching (mitigated by boundary layer ε) > **📚 Deep Dive:** For detailed mathematical foundations, see:

## Step-by-Step Simulation ### Step 1: Verify Installation Before starting, ensure the framework is properly installed: ```bash

# Check you're in the project directory

pwd
# Should show: .../dip-smc-pso # Activate virtual environment (if using one)

source venv/bin/activate # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate # Windows # Verify Python and dependencies
python -c "import numpy, matplotlib, yaml; print('Dependencies OK')"
``` **Expected output:** `Dependencies OK` If you see errors, return to the [Getting Started Guide](../getting-started.md#installation). ### Step 2: Understand Default Configuration Print the current configuration to see what parameters will be used: ```bash
python simulate.py --print-config
``` **Key sections to review:** **Controller Defaults:**

```yaml
controller_defaults: classical_smc: gains: - 5.0 # k₁: First pendulum proportional gain - 5.0 # k₂: First pendulum derivative gain - 5.0 # λ₁: Second pendulum proportional gain - 0.5 # λ₂: Second pendulum derivative gain - 0.5 # K: Switching gain - 0.5 # ε: Boundary layer width
``` **Controller Configuration:**

```yaml
controllers: classical_smc: max_force: 150.0 # Actuator saturation limit (N) boundary_layer: 0.3 # Boundary layer for chattering reduction dt: 0.001 # Control timestep (s)
``` **Simulation Settings:**

```yaml
simulation: duration: 5.0 # Simulation time (seconds) dt: 0.001 # Integration timestep (seconds) initial_state: # Starting condition - 0.1 # x = 0.1 m (cart displaced right) - 0.0 # dx = 0 m/s - 0.0 # θ₁ = 0 rad (upright) - 0.0 # dθ₁ = 0 rad/s - 0.0 # θ₂ = 0 rad (upright) - 0.0 # dθ₂ = 0 rad/s
``` **Physics Parameters:** (see `dip_params` section) ### Step 3: Run First Simulation Execute the simulation with Classical SMC: ```bash

python simulate.py --controller classical_smc --plot
``` **What's happening:** 1. **Configuration Loading** (0.1s) - Reads `config.yaml` - Validates all parameters - Seeds random number generator (for reproducibility) 2. **Controller Creation** (0.01s) - Instantiates `ClassicalSMC` with default gains - Sets saturation limit and boundary layer 3. **Dynamics Model Initialization** (0.01s) - Creates simplified nonlinear dynamics model - Precomputes mass matrix and Coriolis terms 4. **Simulation Loop** (1-3s) - 5,000 integration steps (5.0s / 0.001s) - At each step: * Controller computes force `u` from current state * Dynamics integrates equations of motion * State updated and logged 5. **Post-Processing** (0.5s) - Computes performance metrics - Generates plots **Expected terminal output:** ```
INFO:root:Provenance configured: commit=<hash>, cfg_hash=<hash>, seed=0
D:\Projects\main\src\plant\core\state_validation.py:171: UserWarning: State vector was modified during sanitization warnings.warn("State vector was modified during sanitization", UserWarning)
``` **Note:** The simulation runs with minimal terminal output. The provenance line confirms the simulation configuration is tracked for reproducibility. The state sanitization warning is normal and indicates the simulator is ensuring numerical stability. **⏱️ Total Time:** ~10-15 seconds (includes initialization and plotting) ### Step 4: Interpret Results Two plot windows will appear. analyze each carefully. #### Plot 1: State Trajectories Six subplots showing the evolution of all state variables: **Subplot 1: Cart Position `x(t)`**

- **Initial value:** 0.1 m (displaced right)
- **Behavior:** Slight oscillation, then settles near 0.1 m
- **Why not zero?** Steady-state regulation error due to pendulum stabilization priority **Subplot 2: Cart Velocity `dx(t)`**
- **Initial value:** 0 m/s
- **Behavior:** Oscillates initially, converges to ~0 m/s
- **Peak:** ~0.3 m/s during transient **Subplot 3: First Pendulum Angle `θ₁(t)`**
- **Initial value:** 0 rad (upright)
- **Behavior:** Remains near zero (pendulums start stable)
- **Observation:** Small oscillations (~±0.02 rad) due to cart motion coupling **Subplot 4: First Pendulum Velocity `dθ₁(t)`**
- **Initial value:** 0 rad/s
- **Behavior:** Small oscillations, settles to zero
- **Peak:** ~±1.0 rad/s during transient **Subplot 5: Second Pendulum Angle `θ₂(t)`**
- **Initial value:** 0 rad (upright)
- **Behavior:** Similar to θ₁, stays near zero
- **Coupling:** Notice correlation with θ₁ motion **Subplot 6: Second Pendulum Velocity `dθ₂(t)`**
- **Initial value:** 0 rad/s
- **Behavior:** Oscillates, converges to zero
- **Peak:** ~±1.5 rad/s (higher than θ₁ due to being farther from pivot) **Key Observations:**
1. **Transient phase:** 0-2.5 seconds (oscillations)
2. **Steady state:** 2.5-5.0 seconds (stable, small residual oscillations)
3. **Coupling:** Cart motion induces pendulum oscillations
4. **Stability:** All variables bounded and converging #### Plot 2: Control Input `u(t)` Single plot showing the force applied to the cart: **Time Regions:** **0-0.5s: Initial Response**
- Large force spike: ~40 N
- Direction: Negative (pushing cart left to counter displacement)
- Purpose: Rapid correction of initial perturbation **0.5-2.5s: Active Stabilization**
- Oscillating force: ±20 N
- Frequency: ~2-3 Hz
- Purpose: Balancing pendulums while controlling cart **2.5-5.0s: Steady-State Regulation**
- Small forces: ±5 N
- Purpose: Disturbance rejection and fine regulation
- Observation: Some chattering visible (rapid small oscillations) **Saturation:**
- Max force: ~45 N
- Limit: ±150 N
- Utilization: 30% of available control authority **Chattering:**
- Visible as high-frequency oscillation (~50-100 Hz)
- Magnitude: ~±2 N in steady state
- Mitigation: Boundary layer (ε=0.3) smooths control law #### Performance Metrics Deep Dive **Settling Time: 2.45 seconds** *Definition:* Time until all state variables remain within 2% of their final values. *Computation:*
```python
# For each state variable:
final_value = x[-1]
threshold = 0.02 * abs(final_value)
settling_idx = np.where(abs(x - final_value) > threshold)[0]
settling_time = t[settling_idx[-1]] if len(settling_idx) > 0 else 0
``` *Interpretation:*

- 2.45s is moderate (neither fast nor slow)
- Acceptable for many applications
- Depends on: gains, initial conditions, system inertia **Max Overshoot: 3.2%** *Definition:* Maximum percentage deviation beyond final value. *Computation:*
```python
# For first pendulum angle θ₁:
final_angle = theta1[-1] # ~0 rad
peak_angle = np.max(np.abs(theta1))
overshoot = (peak_angle - abs(final_angle)) / abs(final_angle) * 100
``` *Interpretation:*

- 3.2% is (target: <5%)
- Indicates good damping
- Well-tuned controller (not too aggressive) **Steady-State Error: 0.008 rad (0.46°)** *Definition:* Final tracking error after settling. *Computation:*
```python
# Average error in last 20% of simulation
steady_state_region = x[int(0.8*len(x)):]
steady_state_error = np.mean(np.abs(steady_state_region - desired_state))
``` *Interpretation:*

- 0.008 rad is very good (<1°)
- Sources: friction, model mismatch, discretization
- Acceptable for most control applications **RMS Control Effort: 12.4 N** *Definition:* Root-mean-square of control input over time. *Computation:*
```python
rms_control = np.sqrt(np.mean(u**2))
``` *Interpretation:*

- 12.4 N is moderate
- Much less than saturation limit (150 N)
- Indicates energy-efficient control
- Actuator wear is low #### Expected Results Summary **Typical Performance Ranges** (Default Configuration) | Metric | Expected Range | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Settling Time** | 2.0-3.0 seconds | Time to stabilize both pendulums |
| **Max Overshoot** | 2-5% | Peak deviation from equilibrium |
| **Steady-State Error** | 0.005-0.01 rad | Final angular error (~0.3-0.6°) |
| **Peak Control** | 40-60 N | Maximum force during transient |
| **RMS Control** | 10-15 N | Average control effort |
| **Saturation Events** | 0-2% | Percentage of time at limits | **Visual Behavior Pattern**: ```mermaid

## Understanding Control Behavior ### The Sliding Surface The classical SMC uses a sliding surface defined by: ```
s = k₁·θ₁ + k₂·dθ₁ + λ₁·θ₂ + λ₂·dθ₂
``` With default gains: `k₁=5, k₂=5, λ₁=5, λ₂=0.5` **What does this mean?** - When `s = 0`, the system is on the sliding surface

- Controller drives system to make `s → 0`
- Once on surface, pendulum angles converge to zero **Visualize the sliding surface:**
```python
# Compute sliding surface value
s = 5.0*theta1 + 5.0*dtheta1 + 5.0*theta2 + 0.5*dtheta2 # Plot sliding surface over time
plt.plot(t, s)
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('Sliding Surface s')
plt.title('Sliding Surface Evolution')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
``` **Expected behavior:**

- Initial spike: |s| ~ 2-3 (far from surface)
- Reaching phase: Exponential decay toward zero (0-1 s)
- Sliding phase: Oscillations around zero (1-5 s)
- Magnitude in steady state: |s| < 0.1 ### Control Law Breakdown The control force is computed as: ```python
u = -K · tanh(s / ε)
``` Where:
- `K = 0.5`: Switching gain (control authority)
- `ε = 0.3`: Boundary layer width (chattering reduction)
- `tanh()`: Smooth approximation to sign() function **Without boundary layer (ε → 0):**
```

u = -K · sign(s) # Pure switching (causes chattering)
``` **With boundary layer:**
```

u = -K · tanh(s / ε) # Smooth transition (reduces chattering)
``` **Boundary layer effect:**
- When |s| > ε: Control ≈ ±K (full control)
- When |s| < ε: Control proportional to s (smooth transition)
- Larger ε: Less chattering, but more tracking error
- Smaller ε: Better tracking, but more chattering

## Experiment: Modify Parameters ### Experiment 1: Change Initial Conditions Edit `config.yaml`: ```yaml
simulation: initial_state: [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0] # First pendulum tilted 0.15 rad (8.6°) to the right
``` Run simulation:

```bash
python simulate.py --controller classical_smc --plot
``` **Expected changes:**

- Larger pendulum oscillations
- Longer settling time (~3.0s)
- Higher control effort (~18 N RMS)
- Overshoot may increase to ~6-8% **Why?** Larger initial perturbation requires more aggressive control response. ### Experiment 2: Increase Controller Gains Edit `config.yaml`: ```yaml
controller_defaults: classical_smc: gains: - 10.0 # k₁ (was 5.0) - 10.0 # k₂ (was 5.0) - 10.0 # λ₁ (was 5.0) - 1.0 # λ₂ (was 0.5) - 1.0 # K (was 0.5) - 0.5 # ε (unchanged)
``` Run simulation:
```bash

python simulate.py --controller classical_smc --plot
``` **Expected changes:**
- ✅ Faster settling time (~1.8s)
- ❌ Higher overshoot (~8-10%)
- ❌ More chattering visible
- ❌ Higher control effort (~25 N RMS) **Trade-off:** Speed vs smoothness ### Experiment 3: Wider Boundary Layer Edit `config.yaml`: ```yaml
controllers: classical_smc: boundary_layer: 1.0 # Increased from 0.3
``` Run simulation:

```bash
python simulate.py --controller classical_smc --plot
``` **Expected changes:**

- ✅ Much less chattering (smoother control)
- ❌ Larger steady-state error (~0.02 rad)
- ≈ Similar settling time **Trade-off:** Smoothness vs accuracy ### Experiment 4: Moving Cart Initial Condition Edit `config.yaml`: ```yaml
simulation: initial_state: [0.0, 1.0, 0.05, 0.0, -0.05, 0.0] # Cart moving at 1.0 m/s, pendulums slightly perturbed
``` Run simulation:
```bash

python simulate.py --controller classical_smc --plot
``` **Expected changes:**
- Large initial cart velocity requires strong braking force
- Peak control may reach ~60-80 N
- Pendulums oscillate more due to cart deceleration
- Settling time may increase to ~3.5s **Observation:** Controller handles moving initial conditions well.

## Common Issues and approaches ### Issue 1: Simulation Diverges (State Variables Explode) **Symptoms:** Angles grow to ±π, velocities increase without bound **Causes:**
- Gains too low (insufficient control authority)
- Timestep too large (numerical instability)
- Initial condition too far from equilibrium **Solutions:**
1. Increase gains (try doubling all gains)
2. Decrease timestep: `dt: 0.0005`
3. Reduce initial perturbation
4. Check for typos in configuration ### Issue 2: Excessive Chattering **Symptoms:** Control input oscillates rapidly (100+ Hz), loud in plots **Causes:**
- Boundary layer too small
- Switching gain too high
- Using `sign()` instead of `tanh()` **Solutions:**
1. Increase boundary layer: `boundary_layer: 0.5` or higher
2. Reduce switching gain K
3. Verify smooth switching is enabled ### Issue 3: Slow Convergence **Symptoms:** Settling time > 5 seconds, system still oscillating at t=5s **Causes:**
- Gains too low
- System heavily damped (not typical for DIP) **Solutions:**
1. Increase proportional gains (k₁, λ₁)
2. Increase derivative gains (k₂, λ₂)
3. Check physical parameters are correct ### Issue 4: High Overshoot **Symptoms:** Overshoot > 20%, large oscillations **Causes:**
- Gains too high (too aggressive)
- Insufficient damping **Solutions:**
1. Reduce proportional gains slightly
2. Increase derivative gains (improve damping)
3. Follow PSO optimization (Tutorial 03)
