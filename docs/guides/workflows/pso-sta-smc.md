# PSO Optimization Guide: Super-Twisting SMC
**MCP-Validated Workflow**

**Controller Type:** Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control (STA-SMC)
**Validation Date:** 2025-10-07
**Test Command:** `/optimize-controller sta_smc`

---

## Overview

Super-Twisting SMC is a **second-order sliding mode** controller that provides:
- ✅ **Reduced chattering** compared to classical SMC
- ✅ **Finite-time convergence** to sliding surface
- ✅ **Continuous control signal** (no discontinuous switching)
- ✅ **Robustness** to matched uncertainties

### When to Use STA-SMC

**Use STA-SMC when:**
- Chattering reduction is critical
- Smooth control signals required
- Sensor noise is significant
- Actuator bandwidth is limited

**Prefer Classical SMC when:**
- Maximum simplicity needed
- Chattering acceptable
- Fast implementation priority

---

## Mathematical Background

### Super-Twisting Algorithm

**Control Law:**
```
u = -K₁·|s|^(1/2)·sign(s) + u₂
u̇₂ = -K₂·sign(s)
```

Where:
- `s`: Sliding surface
- `K₁`: First-order gain (proportional to √|s|)
- `K₂`: Second-order gain (integral of sign(s))

**Sliding Surface:**
```
s = k₁·θ₁ + k₂·θ̇₁ + λ₁·θ₂ + λ₂·θ̇₂
```

### Stability Conditions

For finite-time convergence:
```
K₂ > K₁·ρ/2
K₁ > 2·√(L·ρ)
```

Where:
- `ρ`: Upper bound on perturbations
- `L`: Lipschitz constant of perturbations

## PSO Optimization: Real Validated Example

### MCP Command Execution

```bash
/optimize-controller sta_smc
```

### Real Results (Captured 2025-10-07)

**Pre-Optimization (Default Gains):**
```python
default_gains = [
    8.0,   # K1: Algorithmic gain
    4.0,   # K2: Algorithmic gain
    12.0,  # k1: Surface gain
    6.0,   # k2: Surface gain
    4.85,  # λ1: Surface coefficient
    3.43   # λ2: Surface coefficient
]
```

**Optimization Execution:**
```
✓ Swarm Size: 40 particles
✓ Iterations: 200/200
✓ Execution Time: ~35 seconds
✓ PSO Parameters: c1=2.0, c2=2.0, w=0.7
✓ Convergence: Achieved
```

**Post-Optimization (PSO Gains):**
```python
optimized_gains = [
    23.67,  # K1: 2.96× increase → stronger convergence
    13.29,  # K2: 3.32× increase → better robustness
    8.87,   # k1: 0.74× (decreased) → less aggressive surface
    3.55,   # k2: 0.59× (decreased) → smoother dynamics
    6.52,   # λ1: 1.34× increase → moderate damping
    2.93    # λ2: 0.85× (decreased) → refined tuning
]

```

### Gain Interpretation

**K1 & K2 (Super-Twisting Gains):**
- K1 increased 2.96× → Faster convergence to surface
- K2 increased 3.32× → Enhanced disturbance rejection
- Ratio K2/K1 = 0.56 → Satisfies stability condition (K2 > 0.5·K1)

**Surface Gains (k1, k2):**
- Both decreased → Less aggressive surface dynamics
- Trade-off: Stability margin vs performance

**Surface Coefficients (λ1, λ2):**
- λ1 increased 34% → Better position tracking (pendulum 2)
- λ2 decreased 15% → Smoother velocity response

## Parameter Bounds and Tuning Guidelines

### Default PSO Bounds (from config.yaml)

```yaml
bounds:
  sta_smc:
    K1:       [0.1, 30.0]   # Super-twisting gain 1
    K2:       [0.1, 30.0]   # Super-twisting gain 2
    k1:       [0.1, 30.0]   # Surface gain (pendulum 1)
    k2:       [0.1, 30.0]   # Surface gain (pendulum 2)
    lambda1:  [0.1, 30.0]   # Surface coefficient 1
    lambda2:  [0.1, 30.0]   # Surface coefficient 2
```

### Tuning Guidelines

**K1 (Super-Twisting Gain 1):**
- Controls convergence speed to sliding surface
- Higher K1 → Faster convergence, more aggressive
- Typical range: 5-25
- Too high: Chattering may return
- Too low: Slow convergence

**K2 (Super-Twisting Gain 2):**
- Provides robustness and disturbance rejection
- Must satisfy: K2 > 0.5·K1
- Typical range: 3-20
- Higher K2 → Better disturbance rejection
- Too high: Excessive control effort

**Surface Gains (k1, k2):**
- Define sliding surface shape
- Similar to classical SMC surface gains
- Balance responsiveness vs stability
- Typical range: 3-15

**Surface Coefficients (λ1, λ2):**
- Control damping characteristics
- Higher λ → More damping, slower response
- Lower λ → Faster response, potential overshoot
- Typical range: 1-10

### Stability Verification

**Check K2/K1 Ratio:**
```python
# Load optimized gains
with open('optimized_gains_sta_smc_phase53.json', 'r') as f:
    gains = json.load(f)['sta_smc']

K1, K2 = gains[0], gains[1]
ratio = K2 / K1

print(f"K1 = {K1:.2f}")
print(f"K2 = {K2:.2f}")
print(f"K2/K1 = {ratio:.3f}")

if ratio > 0.5:
    print("✅ Stability condition satisfied (K2 > 0.5·K1)")
else:
    print("❌ WARNING: Stability condition violated!")
```

**Real Validation:**
```
K1 = 23.67
K2 = 13.29
K2/K1 = 0.561
✅ Stability condition satisfied (K2 > 0.5·K1)
```

## Troubleshooting STA-SMC Optimization

### Issue 1: Chattering Returns After Optimization

**Symptoms:**
- High-frequency oscillations in control signal
- Excessive actuator switching
- K1 or K2 too high

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Tighten K1 and K2 bounds
# Edit config.yaml:
bounds:
  sta_smc:
    K1: [5.0, 20.0]   # Reduce maximum
    K2: [3.0, 15.0]   # Reduce maximum

# Re-run optimization
/optimize-controller sta_smc
```

### Issue 2: Slow Convergence

**Symptoms:**
- Takes >5 seconds to stabilize
- K1 too low
- Surface gains too conservative

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Increase minimum K1
bounds:
  sta_smc:
    K1: [10.0, 30.0]  # Increase minimum
    k1: [5.0, 20.0]   # More aggressive surface
    k2: [5.0, 20.0]
```

### Issue 3: Excessive Control Effort

**Symptoms:**
- Control saturates frequently
- Energy consumption too high
- K1 and K2 too large

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Add control effort weight to cost function
# Or reduce gain bounds
bounds:
  sta_smc:
    K1: [5.0, 15.0]   # Conservative range
    K2: [3.0, 10.0]
```

### Issue 4: Stability Condition Violated

**Symptoms:**
- K2/K1 < 0.5
- Unstable behavior near sliding surface

**Solutions:**
```python
# Add constraint to PSO
# Ensure K2 > 0.5·K1 during optimization

# Or post-process gains
if K2 < 0.5 * K1:
    K2 = 0.55 * K1  # Add 10% safety margin
```

## Comparison: STA-SMC vs Classical SMC

| Aspect | Classical SMC | STA-SMC |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Control Signal** | Discontinuous | Continuous |
| **Chattering** | Moderate-High | Low |
| **Convergence** | Finite-time | Finite-time |
| **Implementation** | Simple | Moderate |
| **Parameter Count** | 6 | 6 |
| **Computational Cost** | Low | Moderate |
| **Sensor Noise Sensitivity** | High | Low |
| **Best Use Case** | Fast prototype | Production deployment |

### When to Choose STA-SMC

✅ **Choose STA-SMC if:**
- Smooth control signals required
- Actuator has bandwidth limitations
- Sensor measurements are noisy
- Production deployment planned
- Chattering reduction is priority

❌ **Stick with Classical SMC if:**
- Rapid prototyping phase
- Chattering acceptable
- Maximum simplicity needed
- Educational/research purpose

## Advanced: Multi-Objective PSO for STA-SMC

### Custom Cost Function

**Balance performance vs smoothness:**

```python
def sta_smc_cost_function(gains):
    """
    Custom cost for STA-SMC optimization.

    Objectives:
    1. Minimize ISE (performance)
    2. Minimize control effort (energy)
    3. Minimize control rate (smoothness)
    4. Ensure stability (K2 > 0.5·K1)
    """
    K1, K2, k1, k2, lambda1, lambda2 = gains

    # Stability penalty
    if K2 < 0.5 * K1:
        penalty = 1000.0  # Large penalty
    else:
        penalty = 0.0

    # Run simulation
    result = simulate_with_gains(gains)

    # Multi-objective cost
    cost = (
        1.0 * result['ise'] +           # Performance
        0.01 * result['control_effort'] + # Energy
        0.001 * result['control_rate'] +  # Smoothness
        penalty                           # Stability
    )

    return cost
```

### Pareto Front Exploration

```bash
# Multi-objective PSO (future feature)
python scripts/optimization/multi_objective_pso.py \
  --controller sta_smc \
  --objectives performance,smoothness,energy \
  --weights 0.7,0.2,0.1
```
