## Introduction

The collapsible code blocks feature was developed in 6 phases from October 2025. It allows users to collapse and expand code examples in the documentation, making pages easier to navigate and read.

**Key Benefits:**
- Cleaner documentation pages (less scrolling)
- User control over what code to view
- Fast performance (60 FPS animations)
- Works on all modern browsers

**Development History:**
Started as a simple button spacing fix (Phase 1), evolved into a complete feature with accessibility, performance optimization, and full browser support (Phases 2-6).

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-12

### Added

- Collapsible code blocks with smooth curtain animations
- Master controls ("Collapse All" / "Expand All") at top of pages
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+C / Ctrl+Shift+E)
- State persistence via LocalStorage across page reloads
- 100% selector coverage system with debug logging
- Full accessibility support (ARIA, keyboard navigation, reduced motion)
- Mobile responsive design (touch-friendly buttons, adaptive spacing)
- Print-friendly behavior (all blocks expanded when printing)
- Dark mode support with themed colors
- GPU-accelerated animations (60 FPS target)

### Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1:** Button spacing fix (40px → 5-8px gap)
2. **Phase 2:** Architectural fix (true button siblings, wait-and-retry pattern)
3. **Phase 3:** 100% selector coverage + complete debug logging
4. **Phase 4:** GPU-accelerated smooth animations (Material Design easing, double RAF)
5. **Phase 5:** Testing & validation (35+ test cases across 7 categories)
6. **Phase 6:** Documentation & maintenance (this release)

### Performance Metrics

- **FPS:** 58-60 during collapse/expand animations
- **CLS:** <0.05 (Cumulative Layout Shift, well below 0.1 target)
- **Memory:** <100KB total (JS + CSS + localStorage state)
- **Coverage:** 100% (all code blocks matched, math blocks excluded)
- **Button Gap:** 8px desktop, 5px mobile

### Browser Support

- Chrome 90+ (full support with all GPU features)
- Firefox 88+ (full support, partial CSS containment)
- Edge 90+ (full support with all GPU features)
- Safari 14+ (core features work, limited CSS containment)

### Configuration Changes

**How to Enable:**
Add these lines to your Sphinx `conf.py` file:

```python
# In conf.py
html_css_files = [
    'code-collapse.css',  # Add to your existing list
]

html_js_files = [
    'code-collapse.js',   # Add to your existing list
]
```

**Configuration Details:**
- Added `'code-collapse.css'` to `html_css_files` in `conf.py` (line 204)
- Added `'code-collapse.js'` to `html_js_files` in `conf.py` (line 213)

### Technical Details

- **Selectors:** 6 complete patterns for 100% code block coverage
- **Exclusions:** Math blocks (amsmath, math, nohighlight), very short blocks (<10 chars)
- **Animation:** Double `requestAnimationFrame` pattern with Material Design easing
- **GPU Hints:** `contain: layout`, `transform: translateZ(0)`, `will-change`, `backface-visibility`
- **Accessibility:** ARIA labels/states, keyboard focus indicators, reduced motion support
- **State Management:** LocalStorage with graceful degradation
