# Academic Integrity Statement **Status:** To be completed in Phase B (Citation System Implementation)

**Est. Completion:** Week 10 of Phase B

---

## Overview This document will provide a academic integrity statement certifying the proper attribution and citation of all ideas, algorithms, and theoretical foundations in the DIP-SMC-PSO project. ## Planned Content ### 1. Attribution Standards

- All ideas properly attributed to original sources
- Algorithms cite seminal papers and standards
- Theoretical foundations reference peer-reviewed literature ### 2. Citation Coverage
- Target: 150-200 peer-reviewed references
- Coverage: ≥85% of all claims cited
- Verification: All DOIs validated and accessible ### 3. Original Contributions
Clear delineation of project's original work:
- PSO-based SMC gain optimization framework
- Hybrid Adaptive STA-SMC controller design
- validation methodology
- Production-ready control system implementation ### 4. Peer Review Certification
- Technical accuracy verification
- Citation completeness audit
- Attribution correctness review
- Publication readiness approval ## Current State **References:** 39 (baseline)
**Target:** 150-200 (after Phase B)
**Coverage:** ~15% (baseline)
**Target Coverage:** ≥85% ## Related Planning Documents For the complete citation system implementation plan, see:
