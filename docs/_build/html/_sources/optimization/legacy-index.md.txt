## Overview

The PSO optimization system automatically tunes controller parameters to minimize:

- Settling time and overshoot
- Control effort and chattering
- Robustness to uncertainties
- Lyapunov stability margins

The system uses PySwarms with custom cost functions tailored for control systems performance.
