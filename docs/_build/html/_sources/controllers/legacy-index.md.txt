## Overview

The DIP_SMC_PSO project implements multiple advanced sliding mode control strategies:

- **Classical SMC**: Traditional sliding mode with boundary layer
- **Super-Twisting SMC**: Higher-order sliding mode for chattering reduction
- **Adaptive SMC**: Self-tuning controller for uncertainty handling
- **Hybrid Adaptive STA-SMC**: Combined model-based and robust control

Each controller is optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for optimal performance.
