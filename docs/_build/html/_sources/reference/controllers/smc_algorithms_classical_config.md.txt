# controllers.smc.algorithms.classical.config

**Source:** `src\controllers\smc\algorithms\classical\config.py`

## Module Overview

Configuration Schema for Classical SMC.

Type-safe configuration using Pydantic with validation rules based on SMC theory.
Replaces parameter validation scattered throughout the original 458-line controller.

## Classes

### `ClassicalSMCConfig`

Type-safe configuration for Classical SMC controller.

Based on SMC theory requirements:
- Surface gains [k1, k2, λ1, λ2] must be positive for Hurwitz stability
- Switching gain K must be positive for reaching condition
- Derivative gain kd must be non-negative for damping
