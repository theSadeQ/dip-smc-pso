# Week 7: Architecture Diagrams Implementation

**Status:** Integrated into main documentation
**Date:** 2025-10-08



## Overview

Architecture diagrams have been successfully integrated throughout the documentation. This planned work has been completed and distributed across appropriate documentation files.

## Implemented Diagrams

### System Architecture

- **Location:** [README.md](../../README.md)
- **Type:** Mermaid flowchart
- **Coverage:** Complete system overview

### Controller Architecture

- **Location:** [architecture/controller_system_architecture.md](../../architecture/controller_system_architecture.md)
- **Type:** Component diagrams
- **Coverage:** Controller factory and hierarchy

### Simulation Architecture

- **Location:** [mathematical_foundations/simulation_architecture_guide.md](../../mathematical_foundations/simulation_architecture_guide.md)
- **Type:** Sequence and component diagrams
- **Coverage:** Simulation engine flow

### PSO Integration

- **Location:** [factory/enhanced_pso_integration_guide.md](../../factory/enhanced_pso_integration_guide.md)
- **Type:** Workflow diagrams
- **Coverage:** PSO optimization pipeline

## Documentation Structure

All architecture diagrams follow the **C4 model** principles:
1. **Context diagrams** - System overview
2. **Container diagrams** - High-level components
3. **Component diagrams** - Detailed subsystems
4. **Code diagrams** - Class relationships (via API reference)
