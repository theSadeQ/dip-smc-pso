## Convergence Theory Overview

PSO convergence theory covers:

### 1. Theoretical Guarantees

- Global convergence under specific conditions
- Particle velocity convergence
- Swarm stability analysis

### 2. Convergence Criteria

- **Fitness-based:** Minimal improvement threshold
- **Position-based:** Particle position stability
- **Velocity-based:** Velocity magnitude decay

### 3. Empirical Analysis

- Convergence rates for different problems
- Parameter influence (Ï‰, c1, c2)
- Early stopping mechanisms
