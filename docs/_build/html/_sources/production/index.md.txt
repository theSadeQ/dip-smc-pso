## Production Readiness Score

**Current Score: 6.1/10** (improved from 5.2/10)

### Key Improvements
- Dependency safety verified
- Memory management bounded
- Single point of failure (SPOF) mitigated
- Configuration resilience enhanced

### Remaining Work
- Thread safety validation (currently unsafe for multi-threaded operation)
- Load testing and performance benchmarking
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure
- Automated rollback procedures
