# Results & Plots

This section catalogues the key artefacts produced during the analysis and
verification of the control system.  Place all figures under
`/results/plots/` and record the script, notebook or CLI invocation that
produced them.  Link each plot to the Test ID(s) and KPI(s) it addresses.

| Plot | Generated by | Test ID | KPI(s) | Summary |
|------|--------------|---------|--------|---------|
| Step response (cart position & pendulum angles) | `python simulate.py --step` or `notebooks/verification.ipynb` | T‑001 | KPI‑001, KPI‑002, KPI‑003 | Displays cart position and pendulum angles vs time; used to measure settling time, overshoot and IAE. |
| PSO convergence history | `scripts/reoptimize_controllers.py` | n/a | KPI‑003 | Semi‑log plot of PSO cost vs iteration; indicates convergence speed and final cost. |
| Sensitivity analysis trade‑off | `scripts/sensitivity_analysis.py` | n/a | KPI‑003, KPI‑004 | RMS state error vs control effort as cost weights vary; illustrates trade‑offs between performance and energy usage. |
| Frequency response comparison | `control_analysis.py` or `src/utils/control_analysis.py` | T‑002 | KPI‑004 | Magnitude and phase plots comparing simplified and full models; used to check phase and gain margins. |
| Fault detection trace | `python simulate.py --fault` | T‑003 | Safety | State trajectory under a sensor dropout; shows the FDI residual and status transition from OK to FAULT.  Safe‑state enforcement (zero force) is performed outside the FDI. |
