## Opening Hook

You've seen the controllers, understood the control laws, and compared performance. But where do the system dynamics come from? How do engineers derive the equations of motion for a double-inverted pendulum? Why are they called "nonlinear"?

Welcome to Sub-Phase 4.3: Advanced Math for S-M-C. In this episode, this will explore Lagrangian mechanics conceptually, not with rigorous proofs. You'll understand what kinetic energy T, potential energy V, and the Lagrangian L equals T minus V represent. You'll see the structure of the equations of motion: mass matrix M of theta, Coriolis terms C, gravity terms G. And the system will grasp why these equations are nonlinear and what that means for control.

By the end, the system will have the mathematical foundation to understand advanced control theory papers.

## What You'll Discover

## Lagrangian Mechanics: The Big Picture

Lagrangian mechanics is a framework for deriving equations of motion for mechanical systems. Instead of using forces and accelerations directly, which gets messy for complex systems, Lagrangian mechanics uses energy.

**The Core Idea:**

Every mechanical system has:
1. **Kinetic Energy (T)**: Energy of motion. For the cart, it's one-half M times x-dot squared. For pendulums, it includes rotational kinetic energy.
2. **Potential Energy (V)**: Energy of position. For pendulums, it's gravitational potential energy: m times g times h, where h is height.

The **Lagrangian** is defined as:

L equals T minus V

**Why T minus V, not T plus V?**

This is a deep result from classical mechanics. The Lagrangian formulation leads to the correct equations of motion when you apply the Euler-Lagrange equations, which this will see shortly.

Think of L as a function that captures the system's energy balance. When L is maximized or minimized in a specific sense, you get the natural motion of the system.

## Kinetic Energy for the Double-Inverted Pendulum

conceptually build the kinetic energy T.

**Cart kinetic energy:**

T underscore cart equals one-half times M times x-dot squared

where M is the cart mass and x-dot is the cart velocity.

**Pendulum 1 kinetic energy:**

Pendulum 1 rotates about its pivot. It has:
- Translational kinetic energy (the pivot is moving with the cart)
- Rotational kinetic energy (the pendulum spins)

T underscore pendulum1 equals one-half times m1 times open-paren velocity of center of mass close-paren squared plus one-half times I1 times theta1-dot squared

where m1 is pendulum 1 mass, I1 is moment of inertia, and theta1-dot is angular velocity.

The velocity of the center of mass depends on both x-dot (cart motion) and theta1-dot (pendulum rotation). This coupling is key.

**Pendulum 2 kinetic energy:**

Similar, but even more complex because pendulum 2's pivot (the tip of pendulum 1) is moving due to both cart motion and pendulum 1 rotation.

T underscore pendulum2 equals one-half times m2 times open-paren velocity of center of mass close-paren squared plus one-half times I2 times theta2-dot squared

**Total kinetic energy:**

T equals T underscore cart plus T underscore pendulum1 plus T underscore pendulum2

When you expand this, you get terms with x-dot squared, theta1-dot squared, theta2-dot squared, and cross terms like x-dot times theta1-dot. These cross terms represent coupling between degrees of freedom.

## Potential Energy for the Double-Inverted Pendulum

Potential energy is simpler: it's gravitational potential energy.

**Cart potential energy:**

V underscore cart equals 0

We define the zero-level at the cart's height, so it contributes nothing.

**Pendulum 1 potential energy:**

V underscore pendulum1 equals m1 times g times h1

where h1 is the height of pendulum 1's center of mass above the zero-level.

For an inverted pendulum, h1 depends on theta1:

h1 equals L1 times cos open-paren theta1 close-paren

where L1 is the length from pivot to center of mass.

**Pendulum 2 potential energy:**

V underscore pendulum2 equals m2 times g times h2

h2 depends on both theta1 and theta2 because pendulum 2's base is at the tip of pendulum 1.

**Total potential energy:**

V equals V underscore pendulum1 plus V underscore pendulum2

When you expand this, you get terms involving cos open-paren theta1 close-paren and cos open-paren theta2 close-paren.

## The Lagrangian: L equals T minus V

Now we construct the Lagrangian:

L equals T minus V

Substituting the kinetic and potential energies:

L equals open-bracket one-half M x-dot squared plus one-half m1 times (velocity terms) squared plus ... close-bracket minus open-bracket m1 g L1 cos open-paren theta1 close-paren plus m2 g h2 close-bracket

This is a function of generalized coordinates q equals open-bracket x comma theta1 comma theta2 close-bracket and their time derivatives q-dot equals open-bracket x-dot comma theta1-dot comma theta2-dot close-bracket.

**L of q comma q-dot, t** is the Lagrangian.

## Euler-Lagrange Equations

To derive the equations of motion, we apply the Euler-Lagrange equations:

d over d-t of open-paren partial L over partial q-dot close-paren minus partial L over partial q equals Q

where Q is the generalized force (in our case, the control force F acting on the cart).

**What does this mean?**

For each generalized coordinate (x, theta1, theta2), you compute:
1. partial L over partial q-dot: the derivative of L with respect to the velocity
2. d over d-t of that: the time derivative
3. partial L over partial q: the derivative of L with respect to the position
4. Subtract: you get the equation of motion for that coordinate

This is a systematic recipe. You don't need to think about forces and torques individually. The Lagrangian handles it automatically.

## Equations of Motion Structure

After applying Euler-Lagrange equations and simplifying, you get the equations of motion in this form:

M of theta times q double-dot plus C of theta comma theta-dot times theta-dot plus G of theta equals B times F

**Breaking this down:**

**M of theta**: Mass matrix, a 3-by-3 matrix that depends on the pendulum angles theta1 and theta2. It represents the inertia of the system.

**q double-dot**: Vector of accelerations open-bracket x double-dot comma theta1 double-dot comma theta2 double-dot close-bracket.

**C of theta comma theta-dot**: Coriolis and centrifugal matrix. It depends on angles and angular velocities. It represents velocity-dependent forces.

**theta-dot**: Vector of velocities open-bracket x-dot comma theta1-dot comma theta2-dot close-bracket.

**G of theta**: Gravity vector, a 3-by-1 vector that depends on angles. It represents gravitational forces.

**B**: Input matrix, a 3-by-1 vector that specifies which degrees of freedom the control force F affects. For the cart, B equals open-bracket 1 comma 0 comma 0 close-bracket transpose, meaning F acts only on x, not directly on theta1 or theta2.

**F**: Control force applied by the controller.

**This is the canonical form for robotic and mechanical systems.**

## Recap: Core Concepts

recap what we've covered so far.

**Lagrangian Mechanics**: Uses energy (T and V) instead of forces to derive equations of motion.

**Lagrangian**: L equals T minus V, where T is kinetic energy and V is potential energy.

**Euler-Lagrange Equations**: A systematic recipe for deriving equations of motion from the Lagrangian.

**Equations of Motion**: M of theta times q double-dot plus C times theta-dot plus G of theta equals B times F.

**Mass Matrix M of theta**: Represents inertia, depends on pendulum angles.

**Coriolis/Centrifugal Terms C**: Velocity-dependent forces.

**Gravity Terms G of theta**: Gravitational forces, depend on angles.

## The Mass Matrix: Structure and Coupling

look at the mass matrix M of theta more closely (simplified, conceptual):

M of theta equals open-bracket
  M plus m1 plus m2 comma  m1 L1 cos open-paren theta1 close-paren plus m2 L cos open-paren theta1 close-paren comma  m2 L2 cos open-paren theta2 close-paren
  m1 L1 cos open-paren theta1 close-paren comma  open-paren m1 plus m2 close-paren L1 squared comma  m2 L1 L2 cos open-paren theta1 minus theta2 close-paren
  m2 L2 cos open-paren theta2 close-paren comma  m2 L1 L2 cos open-paren theta1 minus theta2 close-paren comma  m2 L2 squared
close-bracket

**Key observations:**

**Diagonal terms**: Represent direct inertias. For example, M plus m1 plus m2 is the total mass affecting cart acceleration.

**Off-diagonal terms**: Represent coupling. For example, m1 L1 cos open-paren theta1 close-paren couples cart motion to pendulum 1 rotation.

**Angle dependence**: Terms like cos open-paren theta1 close-paren and cos open-paren theta1 minus theta2 close-paren make M a function of the state. This is what makes the system nonlinear.

**Why coupling matters:**

When you accelerate the cart (x double-dot), it creates a torque on the pendulums due to the coupling terms. Conversely, when pendulums swing, they exert forces on the cart.

This coupling is why balancing the double-inverted pendulum is challenging. The degrees of freedom are interconnected.

## Coriolis and Centrifugal Terms

The Coriolis matrix C of theta comma theta-dot contains terms proportional to velocities. Conceptually:

C of theta comma theta-dot times theta-dot equals vector of terms like theta1-dot squared times sin open-paren theta1 close-paren

**What do these represent?**

**Centrifugal forces**: When a pendulum rotates, centrifugal force pushes outward. For example, theta1-dot squared times sin open-paren theta1 close-paren represents the centrifugal effect of pendulum 1 rotation.

**Coriolis forces**: When two rotating parts interact, Coriolis forces arise. For example, theta1-dot times theta2-dot terms represent interaction between the two pendulum rotations.

**Why do they matter?**

At high angular velocities, centrifugal and Coriolis forces become significant. They can destabilize the system if not accounted for.

S-M-C's switching control provides robustness against these terms, even without modeling them exactly.

## Gravity Terms

The gravity vector G of theta contains terms like:

G of theta equals open-bracket 0 comma negative open-paren m1 plus m2 close-paren g L1 sin open-paren theta1 close-paren comma negative m2 g L2 sin open-paren theta2 close-paren close-bracket transpose

**What do these represent?**

**For the cart**: No direct gravitational force (G open-bracket 0 close-bracket equals 0).

**For pendulum 1**: Gravitational torque proportional to sin open-paren theta1 close-paren. When theta1 is positive (pendulum leaning right), the torque tries to pull it down.

**For pendulum 2**: Similar, proportional to sin open-paren theta2 close-paren.

**Why sin instead of just theta?**

Because torque depends on the lever arm. When theta is small, sin open-paren theta close-paren approximately equals theta (linearization). But for large angles, sin open-paren theta close-paren is nonlinear.

## Why the Equations Are Nonlinear

Now we can answer the key question: why are the equations nonlinear?

**Reason 1: Trigonometric Functions**

Terms like cos open-paren theta1 close-paren, sin open-paren theta1 close-paren, cos open-paren theta1 minus theta2 close-paren appear in M, C, and G. These are nonlinear functions of the state.

**Reason 2: State-Dependent Coefficients**

The mass matrix M depends on theta. So the equations have the form:

M of theta times q double-dot equals stuff

This is a nonlinear differential equation because the coefficients (elements of M) depend on the state.

**Reason 3: Velocity-Squared Terms**

Coriolis and centrifugal terms include theta-dot squared. This is nonlinear in the velocities.

**Contrast with linear systems:**

A linear system has the form:

A times x double-dot plus B times x-dot plus C times x equals F

where A, B, C are constant matrices. The double-inverted pendulum doesn't fit this form because M, C, and G are state-dependent.

## Implications for Control

Why does nonlinearity matter?

**Linear control theory doesn't directly apply:**

Techniques like pole placement and L-Q-R (Linear Quadratic Regulator) assume linear dynamics. For the double-inverted pendulum, you'd have to linearize around the upright equilibrium.

**Linearization is only valid near equilibrium:**

If the pendulum angles are small, sin open-paren theta close-paren approximately equals theta, and you can approximate the system as linear. But for large angles (e.g., during swing-up), linearization fails.

**Nonlinear control methods are needed:**

S-M-C is a nonlinear control method. It doesn't require linearization. It works for large deviations from equilibrium, making it robust.

**This is why S-M-C is effective**: it handles the full nonlinear dynamics without approximation.

## What's Next

In Episode 12, this will explore vector calculus for control. You'll learn about gradients, Jacobians, and the chain rule for multivariable functions. These tools appear everywhere in control theory papers and are essential for understanding linearization and stability analysis.

Here's a preview question: What is a gradient vector, and what does it represent geometrically? We'll answer this next episode.

## Pause and Reflect

Before moving to Episode 12, ask yourself these questions:

1. What is the Lagrangian, and how is it defined?
2. What are the Euler-Lagrange equations used for?
3. What is the structure of the equations of motion for the double-inverted pendulum?
4. Why is the mass matrix M a function of theta?
5. Name three reasons why the equations are nonlinear.

If you can answer these conceptually, you're ready to proceed. If anything is unclear, focus on the big picture: energy-based derivation, state-dependent coefficients, and nonlinearity from trigonometric functions. You don't need to derive the equations yourself.

**Excellent progress! You've grasped Lagrangian mechanics conceptually. continue!**
