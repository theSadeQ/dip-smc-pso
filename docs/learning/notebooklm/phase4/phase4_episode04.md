**Duration**: 8-10 minutes | **Learning Time**: 2 hours | **Difficulty**: Intermediate-Advanced

## Opening Hook

Imagine you have a perfectly good function that computes control outputs. It works fine, but you wish you could time how long it takes to run. You could add timing code at the beginning and end of the function, but that clutters the logic. Plus, if you want to time ten different functions, you'd have to copy-paste that timing code ten times.

Decorators solve this problem elegantly. They wrap functions with additional behavior without modifying the original code. And type hints solve a different problem: documenting what types of arguments a function expects and what it returns, making your code self-explanatory and enabling effective tools like I-D-E autocomplete and static type checkers.

In this episode, this will demystify decorators and type hints, showing you real examples from the codebase.

## What You'll Discover

In this episode, the system will learn:
- What decorators are and how they wrap functions with additional behavior
- Real examples like at-timing-decorator and at-validate-inputs
- How type hints document expected types and return values
- Common type hint syntax: list, dict, optional, tuple
- Benefits of type hints for I-D-E autocomplete and static analysis with mypy

## What Are Decorators? Function Wrappers

A decorator is a function that takes another function as input and returns a modified version of that function. It "wraps" the original function with extra behavior.

Here's the simplest possible example:

```
def simple underscore decorator open-paren func close-paren colon
    def wrapper open-paren close-paren colon
        print open-paren quote Before calling function quote close-paren
        result equals func open-paren close-paren
        print open-paren quote After calling function quote close-paren
        return result
    return wrapper
```

**Breaking this down:**

The simple underscore decorator function takes func as a parameter. Inside, it defines a nested function called wrapper. The wrapper prints a message, calls the original func, prints another message, and returns the result. Finally, simple underscore decorator returns the wrapper function.

Now you can use it:

```
at-simple-decorator
def say underscore hello open-paren close-paren colon
    print open-paren quote Hello exclamation-mark quote close-paren

say underscore hello open-paren close-paren
```

**Output:**

```
Before calling function
Hello exclamation-mark
After calling function
```

The at-simple-decorator syntax is shorthand for:

```
say underscore hello equals simple underscore decorator open-paren say underscore hello close-paren
```

Python replaces the original say underscore hello with the wrapped version.

## Real Example: Timing Decorator

look at a real decorator from this project. Open source slash utils slash timing dot p-y (note: this is simplified for explanation):

```
import time
from functools import wraps

def timing underscore decorator open-paren func close-paren colon
    triple-quote
    Decorator that measures function execution time period
    triple-quote
    at-wraps open-paren func close-paren
    def wrapper open-paren star-args comma star-star-kwargs close-paren colon
        start underscore time equals time dot time open-paren close-paren
        result equals func open-paren star-args comma star-star-kwargs close-paren
        end underscore time equals time dot time open-paren close-paren
        print open-paren f-string quote open-brace func dot underscore-underscore name underscore-underscore close-brace took open-brace end underscore time minus start underscore time colon dot 4-f close-brace seconds quote close-paren
        return result
    return wrapper
```

**What's happening?**

The timing underscore decorator captures the start time with time dot time, calls the original function, captures the end time, prints the elapsed duration, and returns the result.

The at-wraps open-paren func close-paren decorator from functools preserves the original function's name and docstring. Without it, wrapper would masquerade as the original function, confusing debugging tools.

The star-args and star-star-kwargs syntax captures all positional and keyword arguments, allowing the decorator to work with any function signature.

**Usage:**

```
at-timing-decorator
def run underscore simulation open-paren controller comma duration close-paren colon
    # simulation code
    pass

run underscore simulation open-paren my underscore controller comma 10 dot 0 close-paren
```

**Output:**

```
run underscore simulation took 2 dot 3456 seconds
```

You get timing information without cluttering the simulation logic. And if you want to remove timing, just delete the at-timing-decorator line.

## Real Example: Validation Decorator

Another useful decorator validates inputs before calling the function:

```
def validate underscore inputs open-paren func close-paren colon
    triple-quote
    Decorator that validates state vector before computing control period
    triple-quote
    at-wraps open-paren func close-paren
    def wrapper open-paren self comma state comma d-t close-paren colon
        # Validate state
        if len open-paren state close-paren not-equals 6 colon
            raise ValueError open-paren f-string quote State must have 6 elements comma got open-brace len open-paren state close-paren close-brace quote close-paren

        if n-p dot any open-paren n-p dot isnan open-paren state close-paren close-paren colon
            raise ValueError open-paren quote State contains NaN values quote close-paren

        # Call original function
        return func open-paren self comma state comma d-t close-paren

    return wrapper
```

**What's happening?**

Before calling the original function, the wrapper checks:
1. Is the state vector exactly 6 elements? If not, raise ValueError.
2. Does state contain NaN (Not a Number) values? If so, raise ValueError.

Only if both checks pass does it call the original function.

**Usage:**

```
class ClassicalSMC open-paren ControllerInterface close-paren colon
    at-validate-inputs
    def compute underscore control open-paren self comma state comma d-t close-paren colon
        # control law implementation
        pass
```

Now every call to compute underscore control is automatically validated. If you pass a state vector with 5 elements instead of 6, you get a clear error message immediately, not a cryptic index error later.

## Recap: Core Concepts on Decorators

recap what we've learned about decorators.

**What Decorators Do**: They wrap functions with additional behavior. The original function's logic remains unchanged, but extra functionality like timing or validation is added.

**Syntax**: The at-symbol followed by the decorator name before the function definition. This is shorthand for reassigning the function to the decorated version.

**Use Cases**: Timing performance, validating inputs, logging function calls, caching results, enforcing access control.

**Key Tools**: The at-wraps decorator from functools preserves the original function's metadata. The star-args and star-star-kwargs syntax lets decorators work with any function signature.

## Type Hints: Self-Documenting Code

Now let's shift to type hints. These are optional annotations that specify what types a function expects and returns.

Here's a function without type hints:

```
def compute underscore control open-paren self comma state comma d-t close-paren colon
    pass
```

**Questions arise:**
- What is state? A list? A NumPy array? A tuple?
- What is d-t? An integer? A float?
- What does the function return? A number? A vector?

You have to read the docstring or source code to know.

**Now with type hints:**

```
def compute underscore control open-paren self comma state colon n-p dot n-d-array comma d-t colon float close-paren arrow float colon
    pass
```

**Now it's clear:**
- state is a NumPy n-d-array
- d-t is a float
- The function returns a float

Type hints don't change runtime behavior. Python ignores them during execution. But they provide valuable documentation and enable static analysis tools.

## Common Type Hint Syntax

see the most common type hints the system will encounter.

**Primitive Types:**

```
x colon int equals 5
y colon float equals 3 dot 14
name colon str equals quote Alice quote
flag colon bool equals True
```

**Collections from typing Module:**

```
from typing import List comma Dict comma Tuple comma Optional

gains colon List open-bracket float close-bracket equals open-bracket 10 dot 0 comma 5 dot 0 comma 8 dot 0 close-bracket
config colon Dict open-bracket str comma float close-bracket equals open-brace quote mass quote colon 1 dot 0 comma quote length quote colon 0 dot 5 close-brace
position colon Tuple open-bracket float comma float close-bracket equals open-paren 0 dot 5 comma 0 dot 1 close-paren
result colon Optional open-bracket float close-bracket equals None  # Can be float or None
```

**Function Signatures:**

```
def add open-paren a colon int comma b colon int close-paren arrow int colon
    return a plus b

def compute underscore gains open-paren controller colon str comma bounds colon list close-paren arrow List open-bracket float close-bracket colon
    # PSO optimization
    return optimized underscore gains
```

The arrow symbol indicates the return type. If a function doesn't return anything, use arrow None.

## Type Hints in Controller Base Class

revisit ControllerInterface with a focus on type hints. Open source slash controllers slash base dot p-y:

```
from typing import Optional
import numpy as n-p

class ControllerInterface open-paren A-B-C close-paren colon
    def underscore-underscore init underscore-underscore open-paren self comma gains colon list open-bracket float close-bracket comma config colon dict close-paren colon
        self dot gains colon List open-bracket float close-bracket equals gains
        self dot config colon dict equals config
        self dot last underscore control colon float equals 0 dot 0
        self dot history colon List open-bracket float close-bracket equals open-bracket close-bracket

    at-abstract-method
    def compute underscore control open-paren self comma state colon n-p dot n-d-array comma d-t colon float close-paren arrow float colon
        pass

    def reset open-paren self close-paren arrow None colon
        self dot last underscore control equals 0 dot 0
        self dot history equals open-bracket close-bracket
```

**What do these type hints tell us?**

1. gains colon list open-bracket float close-bracket means gains is a list of floats
2. config colon dict means config is a dictionary (keys and values are unspecified)
3. state colon n-p dot n-d-array means state is a NumPy array
4. arrow float means compute underscore control returns a float
5. arrow None means reset returns nothing

Your I-D-E uses these hints to provide autocomplete. If you type controller dot gains dot, the I-D-E suggests list methods like append or pop because it knows gains is a list.

## Benefits of Type Hints

**Benefit 1: Self-Documentation**

Type hints answer "what type?" questions instantly without reading docstrings or source code.

**Benefit 2: I-D-E Autocomplete**

When your I-D-E knows state is an n-p dot n-d-array, it suggests NumPy array methods like dot shape or dot reshape.

**Benefit 3: Static Analysis with mypy**

The mypy tool checks type correctness before runtime:

```
mypy source slash controllers slash classical underscore s-m-c dot p-y
```

If you pass an integer where a float is expected, mypy warns you. This catches bugs early.

**Benefit 4: Refactoring Safety**

If you change a function signature, mypy detects all places where the old signature is used, preventing breakage.

## Recap: Core Concepts on Type Hints

recap what we've learned about type hints.

**What Type Hints Do**: They annotate expected types for variables, parameters, and return values. They're optional and don't affect runtime behavior.

**Common Types**: int, float, str, bool for primitives. List, Dict, Tuple, Optional from typing module for collections.

**Function Signatures**: parameter colon type for parameters, arrow type for return values.

**Benefits**: Self-documentation, I-D-E autocomplete, static analysis with mypy, refactoring safety.

## Pronunciation Guide

Here are the technical terms from this episode with phonetic pronunciations:

- at-symbol: "at" (used in decorator syntax, like at-timing-decorator)
- at-wraps: "at-wraps" (decorator from functools)
- star-args: "star-args" (captures positional arguments)
- star-star-kwargs: "star-star-kwargs" (captures keyword arguments, pronounced "star-star-k-wargs")
- arrow: "arrow" (indicates return type, like arrow float)
- colon: "colon" (separates variable from type, like x colon int)
- n-p dot n-d-array: "NumPy dot n-d-array" (NumPy array type)
- List open-bracket float close-bracket: "List of float" (list containing floats)
- Optional open-bracket float close-bracket: "Optional float" (can be float or None)
- mypy: "my-py" (static type checker for Python)

## What's Next

In Episode 5, this will explore testing with p-y-test. You'll learn why tests matter, the arrange-act-assert pattern, how to write assertions, and how to run tests with coverage reports. We'll walk through test underscore classical underscore s-m-c dot p-y to see how the project validates controller correctness. Testing is the safety net that lets you refactor confidently.

Here's a preview question: What's the difference between a unit test and an integration test? And why does this project have both? We'll answer this next episode.

## Pause and Reflect

Before moving to Episode 5, ask yourself these questions:

1. What is a decorator, and what does it do to a function?
2. How does the at-timing-decorator measure execution time without modifying the original function's code?
3. What are type hints, and do they affect runtime behavior?
4. Name three benefits of using type hints.
5. What does arrow float indicate in a function signature?

If you can answer these confidently, you're ready to proceed. If anything is unclear, experiment in the Python interpreter. Define your own simple decorator or add type hints to a function and observe I-D-E autocomplete.

**Great work! Decorators and type hints are effective tools. continue!**
