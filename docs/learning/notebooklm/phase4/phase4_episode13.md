# Phase 4 NotebookLM Podcast: Episode 13 - Lyapunov Stability and Phase Space

**Duration**: 10-12 minutes | **Learning Time**: 2.5 hours | **Difficulty**: Intermediate-Advanced

---

## Opening Hook

Welcome to the final episode of Phase 4! You've journeyed from object-oriented programming to Lagrangian mechanics, from reading source code to understanding vector calculus. Now this will bring it all together with Lyapunov stability theory and phase space visualization.

Lyapunov stability is the mathematical foundation that proves control systems work. It lets us prove a pendulum will balance without solving differential equations. Phase space lets us visualize system behavior, seeing trajectories converge to equilibrium or spiral out of control.

By the end of this episode, the system will understand how S-M-C achieves finite-time convergence, why phase portraits are effective analysis tools, and how numerical solvers like scipy dot integrate dot odeint simulate pendulum motion.

**Congratulations in advance on completing Phase 4!**

## What You'll Discover

In this episode, the system will learn:
- Lyapunov stability concept: the ball-in-bowl analogy
- Positive definite functions: V of x greater than 0 for all x not-equals 0
- Decreasing derivative: V-dot of x less than 0 along trajectories
- Pendulum energy example: using total energy as a Lyapunov function
- S-M-C Lyapunov function: V equals one-half s squared
- Reaching and sliding conditions for S-M-C
- Phase portraits: visualizing system behavior in state space
- Differential equation solvers: how scipy dot integrate dot odeint works

## Lyapunov Stability: The Ball-in-Bowl Analogy

Imagine a ball resting at the bottom of a bowl. If you nudge it, it rolls upward briefly, then rolls back down. Eventually, friction brings it to rest at the bottom again. The ball is stable at the bottom because any disturbance leads to return.

Now imagine balancing a ball on top of an inverted bowl. The slightest nudge sends it rolling away, never to return. The ball is unstable at the top.

**Lyapunov stability theory formalizes this intuition.**

**The Bowl = Lyapunov Function V of x**

V of x represents "distance to equilibrium" or "energy." At equilibrium, V equals 0. Everywhere else, V greater than 0.

**The Ball's Position = System State x**

As the system evolves, x of t traces a trajectory.

**Gravity Pulling the Ball Down = V-dot less than 0**

The time derivative V-dot measures how V changes. If V-dot less than 0, V is decreasing, so the system is moving toward equilibrium.

**Key Insight:**

If you can find a function V such that:
1. V of x greater than 0 for all x not-equals 0 (positive definite)
2. V of 0 equals 0 (zero at equilibrium)
3. V-dot of x less than 0 along system trajectories (decreasing)

Then the equilibrium x equals 0 is asymptotically stable.

**Why is this effective?**

You don't need to solve the differential equations! You just need to find a suitable V. If V satisfies the conditions, stability is guaranteed.

## Positive Definite Functions

formalize what "positive definite" means.

**Definition:**

A function V of x is positive definite if:
1. V of 0 equals 0
2. V of x greater than 0 for all x not-equals 0

**Example: Quadratic Function**

V of x equals x1 squared plus x2 squared

At x equals 0, V equals 0.

For any x not-equals 0, at least one of x1 or x2 is nonzero, so V greater than 0.

**This is positive definite.**

**Example: Energy Function**

V open-paren theta comma theta-dot close-paren equals one-half theta-dot squared plus one-half theta squared

At equilibrium (theta equals 0, theta-dot equals 0), V equals 0.

Elsewhere, V greater than 0 because it's a sum of squares.

**Positive definite.**

**Non-Example:**

V of x equals x1 squared minus x2 squared

At x equals open-bracket 1 comma 1 close-bracket, V equals 0 even though x not-equals 0.

**Not positive definite.**

## Decreasing Derivative: V-dot less than 0

The second condition for Lyapunov stability is that V-dot less than 0 along system trajectories.

**How to compute V-dot:**

Recall from Episode 12:

V-dot equals d-V over d-t equals del-V dot x-dot

where del-V is the gradient and x-dot is the system dynamics.

**Example: Damped Pendulum**

System:

theta-dot equals omega

omega-dot equals negative b times omega minus sin open-paren theta close-paren

where b is the damping coefficient.

**Lyapunov function:**

V open-paren theta comma omega close-paren equals one-half omega squared plus open-paren 1 minus cos open-paren theta close-paren close-paren

**Gradient:**

partial V over partial theta equals sin open-paren theta close-paren

partial V over partial omega equals omega

del-V equals open-bracket sin open-paren theta close-paren comma omega close-bracket transpose

**System dynamics:**

x-dot equals open-bracket theta-dot comma omega-dot close-bracket transpose equals open-bracket omega comma negative b times omega minus sin open-paren theta close-paren close-bracket transpose

**Compute V-dot:**

V-dot equals del-V dot x-dot equals sin open-paren theta close-paren times omega plus omega times open-paren negative b times omega minus sin open-paren theta close-paren close-paren

Simplify:

V-dot equals sin open-paren theta close-paren times omega minus b times omega squared minus omega times sin open-paren theta close-paren equals negative b times omega squared

**Analysis:**

V-dot equals negative b times omega squared less-than-or-equal 0

When omega not-equals 0, V-dot less than 0 (strictly decreasing).

When omega equals 0 and theta not-equals 0, V-dot equals 0, but the system eventually reaches omega not-equals 0 due to gravity, so V continues to decrease.

**Conclusion:** The equilibrium (theta equals 0, omega equals 0) is asymptotically stable.

**This proves stability without solving the differential equation!**

## S-M-C Lyapunov Function

Now let's apply Lyapunov theory to sliding mode control.

**Sliding variable:**

s equals theta plus k times theta-dot

**Lyapunov function:**

V equals one-half s squared

**Why this choice?**

V measures the "distance" from the sliding surface s equals 0. When s equals 0, V equals 0 (on the surface). Elsewhere, V greater than 0.

**Gradient:**

partial V over partial s equals s

**Time derivative:**

V-dot equals s times s-dot

**What is s-dot?**

s-dot equals d over d-t of open-paren theta plus k times theta-dot close-paren equals theta-dot plus k times theta double-dot

For the pendulum:

theta double-dot equals negative sin open-paren theta close-paren plus u

where u is the control input.

So:

s-dot equals theta-dot plus k times open-paren negative sin open-paren theta close-paren plus u close-paren

**Control law (simplified S-M-C):**

u equals negative eta times sign open-paren s close-paren

**Substitute:**

s-dot equals theta-dot minus k times sin open-paren theta close-paren minus k times eta times sign open-paren s close-paren

**Compute V-dot:**

V-dot equals s times s-dot equals s times open-paren theta-dot minus k times sin open-paren theta close-paren minus k times eta times sign open-paren s close-paren close-paren

If eta is large enough, the term negative k times eta times sign open-paren s close-paren dominates, making V-dot less than 0.

**Reaching condition:**

V-dot less than 0 ensures the system reaches the sliding surface s equals 0 in finite time.

**Sliding condition:**

Once on the surface (s equals 0), the system stays there if the control maintains s-dot equals 0.

**This is the foundation of S-M-C theory.**

## Recap: Core Concepts

recap Lyapunov stability.

**Lyapunov Function V of x**: A scalar function representing "distance to equilibrium" or "energy."

**Positive Definite**: V of 0 equals 0 and V of x greater than 0 for all x not-equals 0.

**Decreasing Derivative**: V-dot less than 0 along system trajectories.

**Stability Guarantee**: If V satisfies both conditions, the equilibrium is asymptotically stable.

**S-M-C Lyapunov Function**: V equals one-half s squared, where s is the sliding variable.

**Reaching and Sliding**: S-M-C drives the system to the sliding surface (V-dot less than 0), then maintains it there.

## Phase Portraits: Visualizing Trajectories

Phase space is a graphical representation of system state over time. For a simple pendulum, the phase space is 2D: theta on the horizontal axis, theta-dot on the vertical axis.

**Phase Portrait:**

A plot showing trajectories in phase space. Each trajectory represents the system's evolution from a different initial condition.

**Example: Simple Pendulum (No Damping)**

theta double-dot equals negative sin open-paren theta close-paren

**Phase portrait:**

Trajectories form closed loops around the equilibrium (theta equals 0, theta-dot equals 0). The pendulum oscillates forever (energy is conserved).

**Example: Damped Pendulum**

theta double-dot equals negative b times theta-dot minus sin open-paren theta close-paren

**Phase portrait:**

Trajectories spiral inward toward the equilibrium. The pendulum oscillates with decreasing amplitude until it settles.

**Example: S-M-C Controlled Pendulum**

**Phase portrait:**

Trajectories first move toward the sliding surface s equals 0 (a line in phase space). Once on the surface, they slide along it toward the equilibrium.

**Why phase portraits matter:**

They visualize stability intuitively. If all trajectories converge to equilibrium, the system is stable. If some trajectories diverge, it's unstable.

## Sliding Surface in Phase Space

For S-M-C, the sliding surface s equals theta plus k times theta-dot equals 0 is a line in the theta, theta-dot phase plane.

**Equation of the line:**

theta-dot equals negative theta over k

**Geometric interpretation:**

The sliding surface is a line with slope negative 1 over k passing through the origin.

**System behavior:**

**Off the surface**: The control law drives the system toward the surface (reaching phase).

**On the surface**: The system slides along the surface toward the origin (sliding phase).

**At the origin**: Equilibrium. The pendulum is upright and stationary.

**This two-phase behavior (reaching then sliding) is characteristic of S-M-C.**

## Differential Equation Solvers: scipy.integrate.odeint

You've seen the theory. Now let's understand how simulations actually run.

**The Problem:**

Given:

x-dot equals f of x comma t

and initial condition x of 0, find x of t for t in open-bracket 0 comma T close-bracket.

**The Solution: Numerical Integration**

Scipy's odeint function solves this numerically.

**How it works (conceptually):**

1. **Start at x of 0**.
2. **Compute x-dot equals f of x comma t**.
3. **Take a small timestep**: x of t plus delta-t approximately equals x of t plus x-dot times delta-t.
4. **Repeat** for all timesteps until t equals T.

**Actual methods are more sophisticated:**

- Runge-Kutta 4th/5th order: Uses multiple intermediate evaluations per timestep for accuracy.
- Adaptive timestep: Adjusts delta-t dynamically based on error estimates.

**Example usage:**

```
from scipy dot integrate import odeint
import numpy as n-p

def pendulum underscore dynamics open-paren state comma t close-paren colon
    theta comma omega equals state
    theta underscore dot equals omega
    omega underscore dot equals negative sin open-paren theta close-paren  # Simple pendulum
    return open-bracket theta underscore dot comma omega underscore dot close-bracket

# Initial condition
state0 equals open-bracket 0 dot 1 comma 0 close-bracket  # theta equals 0 dot 1 rad comma omega equals 0

# Time points
t equals n-p dot linspace open-paren 0 comma 10 comma 1000 close-paren

# Solve
states equals odeint open-paren pendulum underscore dynamics comma state0 comma t close-paren

# Plot
import matplotlib dot pyplot as plt
plt dot plot open-paren states open-bracket colon comma 0 close-bracket comma states open-bracket colon comma 1 close-bracket close-paren
plt dot xlabel open-paren quote theta quote close-paren
plt dot ylabel open-paren quote omega quote close-paren
plt dot title open-paren quote Phase Portrait quote close-paren
plt dot show open-paren close-paren
```

**This generates the phase portrait we discussed.**

## Recap: Phase Space and Solvers

recap the final concepts.

**Phase Space**: A plot with state variables on the axes. For a pendulum, theta versus theta-dot.

**Phase Portrait**: Trajectories showing system evolution from different initial conditions.

**Sliding Surface**: In S-M-C, a line or plane where s equals 0. Trajectories converge to it, then slide to equilibrium.

**odeint**: Scipy's numerical solver for differential equations. Uses Runge-Kutta or Adams methods with adaptive timesteps.

## What About Phase 5?

You may have noticed this podcast series ends at Phase 4. Here's why:

**Phase 5 (Mastery Path) is Different**

Phase 5 is not a linear learning module like Phases 1-4. Instead, it's an interactive "choose-your-own-adventure" navigation hub with:

- **3 Branching Paths**: Practitioner (5-10h), Researcher (30-50h), Expert (100+h)
- **Decision Trees**: Visual flowcharts requiring path selection based on your goals
- **Interactive Elements**: 11+ decision points, self-assessment quizzes
- **Reference Material**: Career pathways, textbook recommendations, conference listings
- **Meta-Learning**: Pointers to tutorials and resources (not direct teaching)

**This structure is incompatible with linear podcast format.** Audio works beautifully for sequential learning (Phases 1-4), but Phase 5 requires visual navigation, interactive choices, and external resource exploration.

**Where to Find Phase 5**
