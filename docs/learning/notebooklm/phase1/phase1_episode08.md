## Opening Hook

Drop a ball. It falls. Push a cart. It rolls. These everyday observations seem simple, but they contain profound truths about how the universe works. In 1687, Isaac Newton published three laws that explain all mechanical motion - from falling apples to orbiting planets to swinging pendulums.

Today, the system will learn those laws and understand how they govern the double-inverted pendulum the system will soon be controlling. By the end of this episode, the system will see physics not as abstract equations, but as descriptions of real, observable behavior. You'll understand WHY pendulums swing, WHY inverted pendulums fall, and WHY control is necessary to keep them upright.

## Newton's First Law: Inertia

**The Law**: An object at rest stays at rest. An object in motion stays in motion at constant velocity. Unless acted upon by an external force.

unpack this with examples.

**Example One: The Stationary Cart**

Imagine the pendulum cart sitting on the track. No forces act on it horizontally (this will ignore friction for now). According to Newton's First Law, it stays at rest. Forever. It won't spontaneously start moving.

**Example Two: The Moving Cart**

Now imagine the cart rolling to the right at 1 meter per second. With no friction and no applied force, it continues rolling at 1 meter per second forever. Constant velocity. Straight line.

**What This Means**

Objects have inertia - resistance to changes in motion. Stationary objects resist moving. Moving objects resist stopping or changing direction.

This is why you feel pushed back into your seat when a car accelerates. Your body has inertia - it resists the change from stationary to moving. The seat has to push you to overcome that inertia.

**Connection to Control**

When you want to move the cart, you must apply a force to overcome its inertia. When you want to stop it, you must apply force in the opposite direction. The cart doesn't stop on its own (ignoring friction) - inertia keeps it moving.

## Newton's Second Law: F equals ma

**The Law**: Force equals mass times acceleration. Or rearranged: acceleration equals force divided by mass.

This is THE fundamental equation of dynamics. explore what it means.

**The Equation**

F equals m times a

Where:
- F is force in Newtons (N)
- m is mass in kilograms (kg)
- a is acceleration in meters per second squared (m forward-slash s squared)

**What Is Force?**

Force is a push or pull. You apply force when you push a cart. Gravity applies force downward on all objects. Springs apply force when compressed or stretched.

Force is measured in Newtons. One Newton is the force needed to accelerate 1 kilogram at 1 meter per second squared.

**What Is Acceleration?**

Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. If you're standing still and start walking, you accelerated. If you're driving and press the gas pedal, you accelerate. If you're moving and press the brake, you accelerate (decelerate) in the opposite direction.

Mathematically: a equals d-v forward-slash d-t (derivative of velocity with respect to time)

**Example One: Pushing the Cart**

Cart mass: 2 kilograms
Applied force: 10 Newtons

What's the acceleration?
a equals F forward-slash m equals 10 forward-slash 2 equals 5 meters per second squared

The cart accelerates at 5 m/s² as long as you apply 10 N.

**Example Two: Doubling the Mass**

Same force (10 N), but cart mass is now 4 kg:
a equals 10 forward-slash 4 equals 2 point 5 m forward-slash s squared

Heavier objects accelerate less for the same force. This is intuitive - it's harder to push a heavy cart than a light one.

**Example Three: Doubling the Force**

Back to 2 kg cart, but now apply 20 N:
a equals 20 forward-slash 2 equals 10 m forward-slash s squared

More force produces more acceleration.

**Key Insight**

Acceleration is directly proportional to force and inversely proportional to mass. This is why sports cars accelerate quickly (high force from engine, low mass) and trucks accelerate slowly (high mass, similar force).

## Newton's Third Law: Action-Reaction

**The Law**: For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.

When you push on something, it pushes back on you with the same force.

**Example One: Standing on the Ground**

Gravity pulls you down with force m times g (your mass times gravitational acceleration). But you don't fall through the floor. Why? The floor pushes up on you with the exact same force. The forces cancel - you don't accelerate.

**Example Two: Cart and Track**

The cart pushes down on the track with force equal to its weight. The track pushes up on the cart with an equal force. These are action-reaction pairs.

**Example Three: Pendulum and Cart**

When the first pendulum tilts to the right, it pulls on the cart. According to Newton's Third Law, the cart simultaneously pulls on the pendulum with equal force in the opposite direction. This coupling is why moving the cart affects pendulum motion and vice versa.

**Connection to Control**

When your controller applies force to move the cart left, the cart pushes back on the control actuator with equal force. The controller must overcome this reaction to move the cart.

## Recap: Newton's Laws

pause and review:

**First Law (Inertia)**: Objects resist changes in motion. Stationary objects stay stationary. Moving objects maintain constant velocity. Unless forces act.

**Second Law (F equals ma)**: Force causes acceleration. More force means more acceleration. More mass means less acceleration for the same force.

**Third Law (Action-Reaction)**: Forces come in pairs. When A pushes on B, B pushes back on A with equal magnitude, opposite direction.

These three laws explain ALL classical mechanics. Everything from pendulums to rockets to planetary orbits follows these principles.

Now let's apply them to pendulums.

## What Makes a Pendulum Swing?

A pendulum is a mass suspended from a fixed point, free to swing.

**Components**

- Pivot point: Where the pendulum attaches
- Rod or string: Connects pivot to mass (length L)
- Bob: The mass at the end (mass m)
- Angle: Displacement from vertical (theta, measured in radians)

**Why Does It Swing Back and Forth?**

Two competing effects:

**Gravity Creates a Restoring Force**

When the pendulum is vertical (hanging straight down), gravity pulls directly downward. The rod can't stretch, so the mass stays at constant distance from the pivot. No motion.

But if you displace the pendulum to an angle theta, gravity now has two components:
1. Radial component: Along the rod, toward the pivot (creates tension in rod)
2. Tangential component: Perpendicular to rod, toward vertical (creates torque)

The tangential component pulls the mass BACK toward vertical. This is the restoring force.

**Inertia Creates Overshoot**

As the pendulum swings back toward vertical, it accelerates (due to the restoring force). By the time it reaches vertical, it has velocity. According to Newton's First Law, it keeps moving - swinging past vertical to the other side.

On the other side, the restoring force again pulls it back toward vertical. This back-and-forth continues indefinitely (in an ideal, frictionless system).

**Energy Perspective**

At maximum displacement: All potential energy (highest height), zero kinetic energy (momentarily stopped)

At vertical: Zero potential energy (lowest height), maximum kinetic energy (fastest speed)

Energy constantly converts between potential and kinetic. Total energy remains constant (in ideal case).

## The Pendulum Equation of Motion

For small angles (less than about 15 degrees), the pendulum obeys:

theta double-dot equals minus open-parenthesis g forward-slash L close-parenthesis times theta

Where:
- theta is angle from vertical (radians)
- theta double-dot is angular acceleration (second derivative of angle)
- g is gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s²)
- L is pendulum length (meters)

**What This Equation Means**

Angular acceleration is proportional to the angle, but in the opposite direction. If theta is positive (tilted right), theta double-dot is negative (accelerating left). The pendulum always accelerates toward vertical.

**The Solution**

For small angles, the solution is:
theta open-parenthesis t close-parenthesis equals theta-naught times cosine open-parenthesis omega times t close-parenthesis

Where:
- theta-naught is initial angle
- omega equals square root of quantity g forward-slash L (angular frequency)
- t is time

This is simple harmonic motion - sinusoidal oscillation at a constant frequency.

**Period of Oscillation**

Time for one complete swing:
T equals 2 times pi times square root of quantity L forward-slash g

Notice: Period depends ONLY on length and gravity, not mass!

A 1 kg pendulum and a 10 kg pendulum of the same length swing at the same rate. This surprised Galileo when he first discovered it.

## Inverted Pendulum: Unstable Equilibrium

Now flip the pendulum upside-down. Balance it vertically pointing UP.

**The Equation**

For an inverted pendulum (small angles from upright):
theta double-dot equals plus open-parenthesis g forward-slash L close-parenthesis times theta

Notice the critical difference: PLUS instead of minus.

**What This Means**

If theta is positive (tilted right), theta double-dot is also positive (accelerating further right). The pendulum accelerates AWAY from vertical, not toward it.

This is exponential growth. A tiny disturbance grows rapidly:
theta open-parenthesis t close-parenthesis equals theta-naught times exponential of open-parenthesis square root of g forward-slash L times t close-parenthesis

Within seconds, the pendulum falls completely.

**Stable vs Unstable Equilibrium**

Hanging pendulum (downward): Stable equilibrium. Small disturbances decay back to equilibrium.

Inverted pendulum (upward): Unstable equilibrium. Small disturbances grow exponentially away from equilibrium.

**Analogy**

Stable: Ball at the bottom of a bowl. Push it slightly - it rolls back to center.

Unstable: Ball balanced on top of a hill. Push it slightly - it rolls away.

**Why Control Is Needed**

An inverted pendulum CANNOT maintain upright position on its own. It requires constant corrective forces to counteract disturbances and prevent exponential growth.

That's what your controller does - continuously applies force to the cart to keep the pendulum upright despite its natural instability.

## Torque: Rotational Force

For rotating objects (like pendulums), we need torque - the rotational equivalent of force.

**Definition**

Torque equals radius times force times sine of angle:
tau equals r times F times sine of theta

Or more simply, torque equals force times perpendicular distance from pivot.

**Example: Opening a Door**

You apply force F to a door handle at distance r from the hinges. The door rotates because you create torque tau equals r times F.

Why do door handles sit far from hinges? Greater r means greater torque for the same force. Easier to open.

**Pendulum Torque**

Gravitational force acts on the bob (mass m) at distance L from pivot.
Torque from gravity:
tau equals m times g times L times sine of theta

For small theta, sine of theta approximately equals theta:
tau approximately equals m times g times L times theta

This torque causes angular acceleration (theta double-dot).

Rotational version of F equals m times a:
tau equals I times alpha

Where:
- tau is torque
- I is moment of inertia (rotational mass)
- alpha is angular acceleration

For a simple pendulum:
I equals m times L squared

Combining:
m times g times L times theta equals m times L squared times theta double-dot

Simplify:
theta double-dot equals minus open-parenthesis g forward-slash L close-parenthesis times theta

That's the pendulum equation we saw earlier, derived from torque!

## Double-Inverted Pendulum Physics

The double-inverted pendulum has TWO pendulums stacked vertically:
- First pendulum attached to cart
- Second pendulum attached to tip of first pendulum

**Why Is This Hard?**

Three interconnected reasons:

**Reason One: Underactuated System**

You have ONE control input (force on cart) but THREE degrees of freedom to control (cart position, angle 1, angle 2). You can't directly control the angles - you can only indirectly influence them through cart motion.

**Reason Two: Coupled Dynamics**

Moving the cart affects both pendulums. First pendulum motion affects second pendulum. Second pendulum motion affects first pendulum through reaction forces. Everything is interconnected.

**Reason Three: Nonlinear Equations**

For large angles, sine of theta is NOT equal to theta. The full equations include sine, cosine, and products of velocities and angles. Nonlinear equations are much harder to analyze and control.

**State Vector**

To describe the system completely, you need SIX state variables:

1. x: Cart position (meters)
2. x dot: Cart velocity (meters per second)
3. theta-one: First pendulum angle (radians)
4. theta-one dot: First pendulum angular velocity (radians per second)
5. theta-two: Second pendulum angle (radians)
6. theta-two dot: Second pendulum angular velocity (radians per second)

Your controller receives this six-element state vector and must compute the appropriate force to keep both pendulums upright while controlling cart position.

## Why This Matters for Control Systems

Understanding these physics concepts is essential:

**Reason One: The Controller Must Obey Physics**

Your controller can't violate Newton's laws. It must work WITHIN the constraints of F equals ma and torque equations.

**Reason Two: Physical Intuition Guides Design**

Understanding WHY the inverted pendulum is unstable helps you design controllers that counteract instability effectively.

**Reason Three: Simulation Accuracy**

The simulation code implements the physics equations. Understanding the physics helps you debug when simulations behave unexpectedly.

**Reason Four: Performance Limits**

Physics imposes hard limits. Maximum actuator force. Maximum acceleration. Understanding these helps you set realistic controller objectives.

## Pause and Reflect

Before moving on, test your understanding:

1. State Newton's three laws in your own words.
2. If you double the force on an object, what happens to its acceleration?
3. Why does a pendulum swing back and forth?
4. What's the difference between stable and unstable equilibrium?
5. Why is an inverted pendulum unstable?

If you struggled with any of these, review the relevant section. Physics understanding builds on itself - make sure you grasp these foundations.
