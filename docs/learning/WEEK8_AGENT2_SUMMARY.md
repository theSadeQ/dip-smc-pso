## Issues Encountered & Resolutions

### Issue 1: Disturbance Integration Complexity (Tutorial 06)

**Problem:** Full disturbance injection requires modifying SimulationRunner dynamics class.
**Impact:** Code examples in Tutorial 06 use simplified disturbance approach.
**Resolution:** Tutorial clearly documents this is simplified for demonstration; production code needs full integration.
**Status:** RESOLVED (documented limitation)

### Issue 2: PSO Library Dependency (Tutorial 07)

**Problem:** Full PSO implementation requires PSOTuner class from src.optimizer.
**Impact:** Pareto frontier generation in Tutorial 07 uses random search instead of full PSO.
**Resolution:** Tutorial notes this is simplified; production use requires full PSO optimizer.
**Status:** RESOLVED (documented limitation)

### Issue 3: Execution Testing Not Performed

**Problem:** Cannot run simulations without live environment (config.yaml, src modules).
**Impact:** Code examples validated syntactically but not executed end-to-end.
**Resolution:** Syntax verified, logic checked manually, marked for future validation.
**Status:** DEFERRED (validation in future testing phase)

### Issue 4: Time Pressure for complete Testing

**Problem:** 10-hour time constraint limits ability to run full test suite.
**Impact:** Exercises and solutions created but not validated on real hardware.
**Resolution:** All code is syntactically correct and follows existing patterns; validation deferred.
**Status:** ACCEPTABLE (complete testing requires additional time beyond scope)
