## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if I already know Python?**
A: Skip Phase 1.2 (Python Fundamentals) and move directly to Phase 1.3 (Setting Up Environment). You can also take a diagnostic test if unsure.

**Q: How much time should I spend per week?**
A: Aim for 6-8 hours/week. That's 1-2 hours on 4-5 days, or longer sessions on weekends. Adjust to your schedule.

**Q: Can I skip phases?**
A: Only if you already have the prerequisite knowledge. Each phase builds on previous ones. You can take the self-assessment at the start of each phase to determine if you can skip.

**Q: What if I get stuck on a topic?**
A: Each section has remediation paths. If you score less than 70% on the self-assessment, review that section again. Don't skip past confusion!

**Q: What happens after Phase 5?**
A: You transition to [Tutorial 01](../guides/getting-started.md) for hands-on work, or choose a specialization path (Classical SMC, Adaptive SMC, Hybrid Controllers, Super-Twisting Control, etc.).

**Q: Do I need special equipment or software?**
A: Just a laptop with Python 3.9+. Everything else is free and open-source. Windows, Mac, or Linux all work.

**Q: How long does each phase actually take?**
A: Estimates include 40-50% padding for topics that take longer. Adjust to your pace. Understanding is more important than speed.

**Q: Can I work part-time through this?**
A: Absolutely! The 4-6 month timeline assumes 6-8 hours/week. Work at your own pace and adjust the schedule as needed.
