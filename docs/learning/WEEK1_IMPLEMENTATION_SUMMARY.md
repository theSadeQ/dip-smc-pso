**Key Metrics**:
- 5 phase files created (1,287 + 1,336 + 916 + 978 + 621 lines)
- 1 master index created (191 lines)
- 1 folder index created (15 lines)
- 8 clean git commits with descriptive messages
- Sphinx build: 313 HTML files generated (exit code 0)
- Build warnings: 0 errors, all warnings pre-existing (not related to new content)
