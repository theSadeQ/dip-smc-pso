<summary>5.3 PSO Optimization Introduction</summary>

## Phase 5.3: PSO Optimization Introduction (4-6 hours)

**Goal**: Master automated controller gain tuning using Particle Swarm Optimization.

*(This section guides you toward Tutorial 03, which covers PSO in depth)*

### Quick Overview

**What You Already Know** (from Phase 2.4):
- Why optimization is needed (manual tuning is tedious)
- How PSO works conceptually (swarm of particles)
- What an objective function is

**What's New in Tutorial 03**:
- Running PSO optimization: `python simulate.py --run-pso`
- Interpreting convergence plots
- Customizing objective function weights
- Saving and loading optimized gains
- Comparing optimized vs default gains

**Preview: PSO Command**:

```bash
# Optimize classical SMC gains
python simulate.py --ctrl classical_smc --run-pso --save optimized_gains.json

# Loads optimal gains and runs simulation
python simulate.py --ctrl classical_smc --load optimized_gains.json --plot
```

**Typical Results**:
- Optimization time: 10-20 minutes
- Improvement: 20-40% better performance
- Tradeoff customization via objective weights

**When to Use PSO**:
- Designing controller for new system
- Tuning for specific performance goals (speed vs smoothness)
- Benchmarking against other methods

**Next**: Work through Tutorial 03 when ready

**Prerequisites**:
- ✅ Completed Phases 1-4
- ✅ Comfortable reading source code (Phase 4.2)
- ✅ Understand Lyapunov stability conceptually (Phase 4.3)
- ✅ Completed Tutorials 01-03

### Steps to Create Custom Controller

**1. Identify Control Challenge**

Example challenges:
- Reduce settling time below 2 seconds
- Eliminate chattering completely (smooth control)
- Handle sensor noise robustly
- Work with constrained actuators

**2. Research Existing Solutions**

Read papers:
- IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar
- Keywords: "sliding mode control", "double inverted pendulum", "chattering reduction"
- Recent papers (2020+) for state-of-the-art

**3. Design Your Controller**

Modify control law:
- Change sliding surface: s = θ + k1*θ̇ + k2*∫θ (add integral term)
- Add adaptation: update gains online based on tracking error
- Use higher-order sliding modes: s, ṡ, s̈ all driven to zero

**4. Prove Stability (Lyapunov)**

Show that:
1. Lyapunov function V(s) > 0
2. Derivative V̇(s) < 0
3. System reaches sliding surface in finite time

*(Tutorial 04 has step-by-step guide)*

**5. Implement in Code**

```python
# Create new file: src/controllers/my_custom_smc.py

from .base import ControllerInterface

class MyCustomSMC(ControllerInterface):
    def __init__(self, gains, custom_param):
        super().__init__(gains, {})
        self.custom_param = custom_param

    def compute_control(self, state, dt):
        # Your custom control law here
        x, x_dot, theta1, theta1_dot, theta2, theta2_dot = state

        # Define your sliding surface
        s = ...  # Your design

        # Compute control
        F = ...  # Your design

        return F
```

**6. Add to Factory**

```python
# src/controllers/factory.py

from .my_custom_smc import MyCustomSMC

def create_controller(ctrl_type, ...):
    if ctrl_type == 'my_custom_smc':
        return MyCustomSMC(gains, custom_param)
    # ... existing controllers
```

**7. Test and Validate**

```python
# tests/test_controllers/test_my_custom_smc.py

def test_my_controller():
    controller = MyCustomSMC(gains=[...], custom_param=1.5)
    # ... test initialization, control computation, stability
```

**8. Benchmark Performance**

Compare your controller to:
- Classical SMC (baseline)
- STA-SMC (low chattering)
- Hybrid (best overall)

Use Monte Carlo validation (Tutorial 05)

**9. Write Research Paper (Optional)**

If performance is novel:
- Write paper following Tutorial 05 structure
- Submit to conference (IEEE CDC, ACC) or journal (Automatica, IEEE TCST)
