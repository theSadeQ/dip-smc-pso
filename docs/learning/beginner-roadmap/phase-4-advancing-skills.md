## Phase 4.1: Advanced Python for This Project (12 hours)

**Goal**: Master Python concepts used in this codebase - classes, inheritance, decorators, type hints, and testing.

### Learning Path

**Step 1: Classes and Objects (4 hours)**

**Why Classes?**

Controllers are implemented as classes to:
- Encapsulate state (gains, parameters)
- Share common interface (all controllers have `compute_control()`)
- Enable polymorphism (swap controllers easily)

**Example: Controller Base Class**

```python
# src/controllers/base.py (simplified)

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
import numpy as np

class ControllerInterface(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for all controllers.
    Defines the interface that all controllers must implement.
    """

    def __init__(self, gains: list, config: dict):
        """
        Initialize controller with gains and configuration.

        Args:
            gains: List of controller gains [k1, k2, ..., kn]
            config: Configuration dictionary
        """
        self.gains = gains
        self.config = config
        self.last_control = 0.0  # Store last control output
        self.history = []        # Store control history

    @abstractmethod
    def compute_control(self, state: np.ndarray, dt: float) -> float:
        """
        Compute control output for given state.

        This method MUST be implemented by all subclasses.

        Args:
            state: System state [x, x_dot, theta1, theta1_dot, theta2, theta2_dot]
            dt: Timestep (seconds)

        Returns:
            Control force F (Newtons)
        """
        pass  # Subclasses provide implementation

    def reset(self):
        """Reset controller state."""
        self.last_control = 0.0
        self.history = []
```

**Key Concepts**:

1. **Abstract Base Class (ABC)**: Template for other classes
2. **@abstractmethod**: Forces subclasses to implement method
3. **`__init__`**: Constructor, runs when object created
4. **Attributes**: `self.gains`, `self.last_control` (object state)
5. **Methods**: Functions that belong to the class

**Try This** (in Python interpreter):

```python
from src.controllers.base import ControllerInterface
# Can't instantiate abstract class
# controller = ControllerInterface(...)  # Error!

# Must use concrete subclass
from src.controllers.classical_smc import ClassicalSMC
controller = ClassicalSMC(gains=[10, 5, 8, 3, 15, 2])
print(type(controller))  # <class 'ClassicalSMC'>
print(isinstance(controller, ControllerInterface))  # True
```

---

**Step 2: Inheritance (3 hours)**

**Why Inheritance?**

All controllers share common functionality (reset, history tracking) but have different control laws.

**Example: Classical SMC Inherits from Base**

```python
# src/controllers/classical_smc.py (simplified)

import numpy as np
from .base import ControllerInterface

class ClassicalSMC(ControllerInterface):
    """
    Classical Sliding Mode Controller implementation.
    Inherits from ControllerInterface.
    """

    def __init__(self, gains: list, boundary_layer: float = 0.1):
        # Call parent class constructor
        super().__init__(gains, config={})

        # Unpack gains
        self.k1, self.k2, self.k3, self.k4, self.k5, self.eta = gains
        self.boundary_layer = boundary_layer

    def compute_control(self, state: np.ndarray, dt: float) -> float:
        """
        Implement classical SMC control law.
        This is the REQUIRED abstract method from parent class.
        """
        # Extract state variables
        x, x_dot, theta1, theta1_dot, theta2, theta2_dot = state

        # Define sliding surface
        s1 = theta1 + self.k1 * theta1_dot
        s2 = theta2 + self.k2 * theta2_dot

        # Compute control law
        u_eq = -(self.k3 * x + self.k4 * x_dot)  # Equivalent control
        u_sw = -self.eta * np.tanh(s1/self.boundary_layer + s2/self.boundary_layer)  # Switching control

        F = u_eq + u_sw  # Total control

        # Saturate (limit force to [-20, 20] N)
        F = np.clip(F, -20.0, 20.0)

        # Store history
        self.last_control = F
        self.history.append(F)

        return F

    # Inherits reset() method from parent - no need to redefine
```

**Inheritance Hierarchy**:

```
 ControllerInterface (abstract base)
    |
    +-- ClassicalSMC
    +-- STASMC
    +-- AdaptiveSMC
    +-- HybridAdaptiveSTASMC
```

**Benefits**:
- All controllers have same interface (`compute_control()`)
- Can swap controllers without changing simulation code
- Shared functionality (reset, history) written once

---

**Step 3: Decorators (2 hours)**

**What are Decorators?**

Functions that modify other functions (like "wrappers").

**Example: Timing Decorator**

```python
# src/utils/timing.py (simplified)

import time
from functools import wraps

def timing_decorator(func):
    """
    Decorator that measures function execution time.
    """
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)  # Call original function
        end_time = time.time()

        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
        return result

    return wrapper

# Usage
@timing_decorator
def run_simulation():
    # ... simulation code ...
    pass

# Equivalent to:
# run_simulation = timing_decorator(run_simulation)
```

**Validation Decorator**:

```python
def validate_inputs(func):
    """
    Decorator that validates state vector before computing control.
    """
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self, state, dt):
        # Validate state
        if len(state) != 6:
            raise ValueError(f"State must have 6 elements, got {len(state)}")

        if np.any(np.isnan(state)):
            raise ValueError("State contains NaN values")

        # Call original function
        return func(self, state, dt)

    return wrapper

# Usage in controller
class ClassicalSMC(ControllerInterface):
    @validate_inputs  # Function decorated
    def compute_control(self, state, dt):
        # ... implementation ...
        pass
```

**Common Decorators in This Project**:
- `@timing_decorator`: Measure performance
- `@validate_inputs`: Check preconditions
- `@abstractmethod`: Mark method as required in subclass

---

**Step 4: Type Hints (1.5 hours)**

**What are Type Hints?**

Optional annotations that specify expected types (improves readability, enables static analysis).

**Example**:

```python
# Without type hints (confusing)
def compute_control(self, state, dt):
    pass

# With type hints (clear!)
def compute_control(self, state: np.ndarray, dt: float) -> float:
    """
    Args:
        state: System state vector (6 elements)
        dt: Timestep in seconds

    Returns:
        Control force in Newtons
    """
    pass
```

**Common Types**:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Tuple

gains: List[float] = [10.0, 5.0, 8.0]
config: Dict[str, float] = {"mass": 1.0, "length": 0.5}
result: Optional[float] = None  # Can be float or None
position, velocity: Tuple[float, float] = (0.5, 0.1)
```

**Benefits**:
- Self-documenting code
- IDE autocomplete works better
- `mypy` catches type errors before runtime

---

**Step 5: Testing with pytest (1.5 hours)**

**Why Testing?**

Ensure code works correctly, catch regressions, document expected behavior.

**Example Test**:

```python
# tests/test_controllers/test_classical_smc.py

import pytest
import numpy as np
from src.controllers.classical_smc import ClassicalSMC

def test_classical_smc_initialization():
    """Test that controller initializes correctly."""
    gains = [10.0, 5.0, 8.0, 3.0, 15.0, 2.0]
    controller = ClassicalSMC(gains)

    assert controller.k1 == 10.0
    assert controller.k2 == 5.0
    assert len(controller.history) == 0

def test_compute_control_returns_float():
    """Test that compute_control returns a number."""
    controller = ClassicalSMC([10, 5, 8, 3, 15, 2])
    state = np.zeros(6)  # Equilibrium state
    dt = 0.01

    F = controller.compute_control(state, dt)

    assert isinstance(F, (float, np.floating))
    assert not np.isnan(F)

def test_control_saturates():
    """Test that control force saturates at limits."""
    controller = ClassicalSMC([100, 50, 80, 30, 150, 20])  # Very high gains
    state = np.array([0.5, 0, 0.5, 0, 0.5, 0])  # Large disturbance
    dt = 0.01

    F = controller.compute_control(state, dt)

    assert -20.0 <= F <= 20.0  # Within saturation limits
```

**Running Tests**:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_controllers/test_classical_smc.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src
```

<summary>4.2 Reading Controller Source Code</summary>

## Phase 4.2: Reading Controller Source Code (8 hours)

**Goal**: Understand controller implementations line by line.

### Learning Path

**Step 1: Navigating the Codebase (2 hours)**

**Directory Structure**:

```
src/controllers/
├─ base.py                      # Abstract interface
├─ classical_smc.py             # Classical SMC (START HERE)
├─ sta_smc.py                   # Super-Twisting
├─ adaptive_smc.py              # Adaptive
├─ hybrid_adaptive_sta_smc.py   # Hybrid
└─ factory.py                   # Controller creation
```

**Reading Order**:
1. `base.py` - Understand interface
2. `classical_smc.py` - Simplest implementation
3. `sta_smc.py` - More complex
4. `factory.py` - How controllers are instantiated

**Open classical_smc.py** (recommended editor: VS Code):

```bash
code src/controllers/classical_smc.py  # VS Code
# Or use any text editor
```

---

**Step 2: Classical SMC Line-by-Line (4 hours)**

**Section 1: Imports and Class Definition**

```python
import numpy as np
from typing import Optional
from .base import ControllerInterface

class ClassicalSMC(ControllerInterface):
    """
    Classical Sliding Mode Controller.

    Implements the standard SMC control law with:
    - Linear sliding surface
    - Boundary layer to reduce chattering
    - Saturation limits

    Reference: Slotine & Li (1991), "Applied Nonlinear Control"
    """
```

**What this means**:
- Imports NumPy for math operations
- Imports type hints for clarity
- Inherits from `ControllerInterface` (must implement `compute_control()`)
- Docstring explains what this class does

---

**Section 2: Initialization**

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    gains: list[float],
    boundary_layer: float = 0.1,
    saturation_limits: tuple[float, float] = (-20.0, 20.0)
):
    """
    Initialize Classical SMC controller.

    Args:
        gains: [k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, eta]
            k1, k2: Sliding surface coefficients for pendulums
            k3, k4: Equivalent control gains for cart
            k5: Pendulum coupling gain
            eta: Switching control gain
        boundary_layer: Width of boundary layer (reduces chattering)
        saturation_limits: (min_force, max_force) in Newtons
    """
    super().__init__(gains, config={})  # Call parent constructor

    # Unpack gains (validate length)
    if len(gains) != 6:
        raise ValueError(f"Classical SMC requires 6 gains, got {len(gains)}")

    self.k1, self.k2, self.k3, self.k4, self.k5, self.eta = gains

    # Store parameters
    self.boundary_layer = boundary_layer
    self.sat_min, self.sat_max = saturation_limits

    # Initialize internal state
    self.last_control = 0.0
    self.history = []
```

**What this does**:
- Takes gains as input (6 numbers)
- Validates input (must be exactly 6 gains)
- Unpacks gains into meaningful names (k1, k2, ...)
- Stores boundary layer and saturation limits
- Initializes control history

**Try This**:
```python
# Good initialization
controller = ClassicalSMC([10, 5, 8, 3, 15, 2])

# Bad initialization (wrong number of gains)
# controller = ClassicalSMC([10, 5])  # Raises ValueError
```

---

**Section 3: Control Law Implementation**

```python
def compute_control(self, state: np.ndarray, dt: float) -> float:
    """
    Compute control force using classical SMC law.

    Args:
        state: [x, x_dot, theta1, theta1_dot, theta2, theta2_dot]
        dt: Timestep (not used in classical SMC, but required by interface)

    Returns:
        Control force F in Newtons (saturated to limits)
    """
    # 1. Extract state variables
    x = state[0]          # Cart position (m)
    x_dot = state[1]      # Cart velocity (m/s)
    theta1 = state[2]     # Pendulum 1 angle (rad)
    theta1_dot = state[3] # Pendulum 1 angular velocity (rad/s)
    theta2 = state[4]     # Pendulum 2 angle (rad)
    theta2_dot = state[5] # Pendulum 2 angular velocity (rad/s)

    # 2. Define sliding surfaces
    # Sliding surface forces theta + k*theta_dot -> 0
    s1 = theta1 + self.k1 * theta1_dot  # Pendulum 1 sliding variable
    s2 = theta2 + self.k2 * theta2_dot  # Pendulum 2 sliding variable

    # 3. Equivalent control (stabilizes cart position)
    u_eq = -(self.k3 * x + self.k4 * x_dot)

    # 4. Switching control (drives sliding variables to zero)
    # Uses tanh (smooth approximation) instead of sign (discontinuous)
    combined_s = s1 + self.k5 * s2  # Combine sliding surfaces
    u_sw = -self.eta * np.tanh(combined_s / self.boundary_layer)

    # 5. Total control = equivalent + switching
    F = u_eq + u_sw

    # 6. Apply saturation (physical actuator limits)
    F = np.clip(F, self.sat_min, self.sat_max)

    # 7. Store for history/debugging
    self.last_control = F
    self.history.append(F)

    return F
```

**Breaking Down the Math**:

**Sliding Surface** (s1, s2):
- Combines angle and angular velocity
- When s = 0, system is on sliding manifold
- System converges exponentially to equilibrium on manifold

**Equivalent Control** (u_eq):
- Stabilizes cart position
- Linear feedback: proportional to position error and velocity

**Switching Control** (u_sw):
- Drives system toward sliding surface
- High gain (eta) provides robustness
- tanh smooths sign function (reduces chattering)

**Boundary Layer**:
- Region where tanh ≈ linear (not saturated)
- Wider layer → smoother control, slower convergence
- Narrower layer → faster convergence, more chattering

**Saturation**:
- Real actuators have force limits
- `np.clip()` enforces [-20, 20] N

---

**Section 4: Helper Methods**

```python
def reset(self):
    """Reset controller state (clear history)."""
    super().reset()  # Call parent reset
    self.last_control = 0.0
    self.history = []

def get_gains(self) -> list[float]:
    """Return current gains as list."""
    return [self.k1, self.k2, self.k3, self.k4, self.k5, self.eta]

def set_gains(self, gains: list[float]):
    """Update controller gains."""
    if len(gains) != 6:
        raise ValueError(f"Requires 6 gains, got {len(gains)}")
    self.k1, self.k2, self.k3, self.k4, self.k5, self.eta = gains
```

**What these do**:
- `reset()`: Clear history between simulations
- `get_gains()`: Retrieve current gains (for saving)
- `set_gains()`: Update gains dynamically (for optimization)

---

### Self-Assessment: Phase 4.2

**Quiz**:

1. What are the 6 gains in Classical SMC and what do they control?
2. What is a sliding surface?
3. Why use `tanh` instead of `sign` function?
4. What does the boundary layer parameter control?
5. Why is saturation necessary?

**Practical Exercise**:

1. Open `src/controllers/classical_smc.py` in your editor
2. Add print statements to `compute_control()`:
   ```python
   print(f"s1 = {s1:.4f}, s2 = {s2:.4f}")
   print(f"u_eq = {u_eq:.4f}, u_sw = {u_sw:.4f}")
   ```
3. Run simulation, observe how s1, s2 evolve
4. Remove prints when done

**If you can complete quiz and exercise**: ✅ Move to Phase 4.3
**If sliding surface confusing**: ⚠️ Review Phase 2.3 (SMC theory)
**If code unclear**: ⚠️ Add more print statements, run with small disturbance

<summary>4.3 Advanced Math for SMC</summary>

## Phase 4.3: Advanced Math for SMC (10 hours)

**Goal**: Understand the mathematical foundation - nonlinear dynamics, vector calculus, and Lyapunov stability (conceptual level, not rigorous proofs).

### Learning Path

**Step 1: Full Nonlinear Equations (3 hours)**

**Why Full Equations?**

In Phase 2, we used intuition. Now we see the actual equations.

**Lagrangian Mechanics** (conceptual):

The DIP is a mechanical system. Its motion is governed by:
1. **Kinetic Energy** (T): Energy of motion
2. **Potential Energy** (V): Energy of position (gravity)
3. **Lagrangian**: L = T - V
4. **Euler-Lagrange Equations**: Derive equations of motion from L

**Equations of Motion** (simplified notation):

```
M(θ) * q̈ + C(θ, θ̇) * θ̇ + G(θ) = B * F

Where:
- q = [x, theta1, theta2]          # Generalized coordinates
- M(θ) = Mass matrix (3x3, depends on angles)
- C(θ, θ̇) = Coriolis/centrifugal terms
- G(θ) = Gravity terms
- B = Input matrix (which DOF F affects)
- F = Control force
```

**Mass Matrix** (conceptual):

```
M(θ) = [
    M + m1 + m2,     m1*L1*cos(θ1) + m2*L*cos(θ1),     m2*L2*cos(θ2)
    m1*L1*cos(θ1),   (m1+m2)*L1²,                      m2*L1*L2*cos(θ1-θ2)
    m2*L2*cos(θ2),   m2*L1*L2*cos(θ1-θ2),              m2*L2²
]
```

**Key Insights**:
- Matrix depends on θ (nonlinear!)
- Coupling between DOF (off-diagonal terms)
- Must be inverted to solve for accelerations

**You DON'T need to derive these**. Key takeaway:
- Equations are complex, nonlinear, coupled
- Numerical solver (ODE integrator) handles them
- Controller doesn't need full model (SMC is robust!)

---

**Step 2: Vector Calculus Basics (3 hours)**

**Why Vector Calculus?**

SMC theory uses derivatives of vector-valued functions.

**Gradients**:

```python
# Scalar function of vector
V(x) = x² + y²  # Energy-like function

# Gradient (vector of partial derivatives)
∇V = [∂V/∂x, ∂V/∂y] = [2x, 2y]
```

**Interpretation**: Gradient points in direction of steepest increase.

**Jacobian Matrix**:

```python
# Vector function of vector
f(q) = [f1(q), f2(q), f3(q)]

# Jacobian (matrix of partial derivatives)
J = [
    [∂f1/∂q1, ∂f1/∂q2, ∂f1/∂q3],
    [∂f2/∂q1, ∂f2/∂q2, ∂f2/∂q3],
    [∂f3/∂q1, ∂f3/∂q2, ∂f3/∂q3],
]
```

**Use in Control**: Linearization around equilibrium

**Time Derivatives of Vectors**:

```python
# State vector
x(t) = [x1(t), x2(t), x3(t)]

# Time derivative
ẋ(t) = [ẋ1(t), ẋ2(t), ẋ3(t)] = dx/dt
```

**Chain Rule** (multivariable):

```
dV/dt = ∇V · ẋ  # Dot product
```

**Example**:

```python
V(x, y) = x² + y²
x(t) = cos(t), y(t) = sin(t)

∇V = [2x, 2y] = [2cos(t), 2sin(t)]
ẋ = [-sin(t), cos(t)]

dV/dt = ∇V · ẋ = 2cos(t)*(-sin(t)) + 2sin(t)*cos(t) = 0  # Energy conserved!
```

---

**Step 3: Lyapunov Stability (Conceptual) (4 hours)**

**What is Lyapunov Stability?**

A method to prove a system converges to equilibrium WITHOUT solving differential equations.

**Analogy**: Imagine a ball rolling in a bowl.
- Bowl = Lyapunov function V(x)
- Ball's position = system state x
- Gravity pulls ball down → V decreases
- Bottom of bowl = equilibrium (V minimum)
- Ball eventually rests at bottom → stable

**Formal Definition** (simplified):

A Lyapunov function V(x) is:
1. **Positive Definite**: V(x) > 0 for all x ≠ 0, V(0) = 0
2. **Decreasing**: V̇(x) < 0 along system trajectories

If such V exists, system is stable!

**Example: Pendulum Energy**

```python
# Simple pendulum (no control)
θ̈ + sin(θ) = 0

# Lyapunov function (total energy)
V(θ, θ̇) = (1/2) * θ̇² + (1 - cos(θ))

# Time derivative
V̇ = θ̇ * θ̈ + sin(θ) * θ̇
  = θ̇ * (-sin(θ)) + sin(θ) * θ̇
  = 0  # Energy conserved (no damping)

# Conclusion: System is stable but not asymptotically stable
# (ball rolls forever, doesn't settle)
```

**With Damping**:

```python
θ̈ + b*θ̇ + sin(θ) = 0  # Added damping b*θ̇

V̇ = θ̇ * θ̈ + sin(θ) * θ̇
  = θ̇ * (-b*θ̇ - sin(θ)) + sin(θ) * θ̇
  = -b * θ̇²  # Negative! (energy dissipates)

# Conclusion: System is asymptotically stable (ball settles to bottom)
```

**SMC Lyapunov Function**:

For sliding mode control:

```python
# Sliding variable
s = θ + k * θ̇

# Lyapunov function
V = (1/2) * s²  # "Distance" from sliding surface

# Control law designed such that:
V̇ = s * ṡ < 0  # System approaches surface
```

**Reaching Condition**: System reaches sliding surface in finite time.

**Sliding Condition**: Once on surface, system stays there.

**Convergence**: On sliding surface, system converges to equilibrium.

**Phase Portraits and State Space** (visualization, no equations):

**Phase Portrait**: Plot of trajectories in state space.

```
   θ̇ (angular velocity)
    ^
    |     ●────→        ← Trajectories
    |    /
    |   /
    |  ●────→
    | /
    +──────────────────> θ (angle)
    |
    |    Equilibrium (θ=0, θ̇=0) is at origin
```

**Sliding Surface** (in phase space):

```
   θ̇
    ^
    |     ╱ Sliding surface: s = θ + k*θ̇ = 0
    |    ╱   (line in 2D, plane in higher dimensions)
    |   ╱
    |  ╱  ← Trajectories converge to this line
    | ╱
    +╱─────────────────> θ
   ╱ |
```

**Key Insight**: SMC drives system TO the sliding surface, THEN slides along it to equilibrium.

**Differential Equation Solvers** (how simulation works):

**SciPy odeint**:

```python
from scipy.integrate import odeint

# Define system dynamics
def dip_dynamics(state, t, controller):
    """
    Compute state derivatives.

    Args:
        state: [x, x_dot, theta1, theta1_dot, theta2, theta2_dot]
        t: Current time
        controller: Controller object

    Returns:
        derivatives: [x_dot, x_ddot, theta1_dot, theta1_ddot, theta2_dot, theta2_ddot]
    """
    # Compute control force
    F = controller.compute_control(state, dt=0.01)

    # Compute accelerations (using M, C, G matrices - hidden complexity)
    x_ddot = f1(state, F)
    theta1_ddot = f2(state, F)
    theta2_ddot = f3(state, F)

    return [state[1], x_ddot, state[3], theta1_ddot, state[5], theta2_ddot]

# Solve ODE
t = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)  # Time points
state0 = [0, 0, 0.1, 0, 0.1, 0]  # Initial condition
states = odeint(dip_dynamics, state0, t, args=(controller,))
```

**What odeint does**:
1. Start at initial state
2. Compute derivatives using `dip_dynamics()`
3. Take small timestep: state_new ≈ state_old + derivatives * dt
4. Repeat for all timesteps

**Methods**: Runge-Kutta (RK45), Adams, etc. (odeint chooses automatically)

### Self-Assessment: Phase 4.3

**Quiz**:

1. What is the Lagrangian and what does it represent?
2. What is a gradient vector?
3. What are the two conditions for a Lyapunov function?
4. What does a phase portrait show?
5. What does odeint do?

**Conceptual Understanding**:

Can you explain (in your own words, no equations):
1. Why DIP equations are "nonlinear"?
2. How Lyapunov functions prove stability without solving equations?
3. What a sliding surface represents geometrically?

**If you can answer conceptually**: 🎉 **Phase 4 COMPLETE!**
**If math too abstract**: ⚠️ Focus on conceptual understanding, skip derivations
**If want deeper math**: ✅ Read Slotine & Li textbook (graduate level)
