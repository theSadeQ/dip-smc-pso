    ) -> List[ReviewItem]:
        \"\"\"Generate checklist of claims to review.\"\"\"
        claims = load_json(claims_inventory)

        # Prioritize critical claims
        critical = [c for c in claims if c['priority'] == 'CRITICAL']

        review_items = []

        for claim in critical:
            review_items.append(ReviewItem(
