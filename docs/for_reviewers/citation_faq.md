# Citation FAQ **For Reviewers:** Frequently asked questions about citation system and academic integrity **Last Updated:** 2025-10-09 --- ## General Questions ### Q1: What is the overall citation coverage of this project? **Answer:**
- **Total BibTeX entries:** 94
- **DOI/URL coverage:** 94/94 (100%)
- **Documentation citations:** 39 references across 3 main theory files
- **Theorem citations:** 33 unique sources for 11 FORMAL-THEOREM claims
- **Citation density:** 1 citation per 36-46 lines in theory documentation **Verification:** Run `python scripts/docs/validate_citations.py` --- ### Q2: How were citation accuracy verified? **Answer:** All 11 FORMAL-THEOREM claims were manually verified using a 5-step process: 1. **Theorem Statement Review** - Read theorem claim in documentation
2. **BibTeX Metadata Check** - Review `note` field for content summary
3. **Source Access** - Access paper via DOI/URL (when needed)
4. **Mathematical Verification** - Confirm theorem conditions and conclusions match cited sources
5. **Implementation Check** - Verify code implements theorem correctly **Result:** Mean accuracy 99.1%, all 11 theorems PASS **Report:** `.artifacts/accuracy_audit.md` (477 lines) --- ### Q3: Why are some papers cited without full PDF access? **Answer:** We provide **DOI or URL for 100% of entries** (94/94). However: - **80% have DOI** - Persistent identifiers that resolve via university libraries
- **20% have publisher URL** - Direct links to book product pages or publisher sites
- **Textbooks** - Cited from standard references (Khalil, Slotine & Li, Utkin, etc.)
- **BibTeX `note` fields** - Provide content summaries for all entries For paywalled content, access via institutional subscriptions or request from authors. --- ### Q4: Are there any self-citations or conflicts of interest? **Answer:** **No.** This project cites:
- **Established textbooks** - Khalil (2002), Slotine & Li (1991), Utkin (2009)
- **Peer-reviewed journals** - IEEE TAC, IJRNC, Automatica, SIAM JCON
- **Conference proceedings** - IEEE, IFAC, established venues
- **No pre-prints or non-peer-reviewed sources** All citations are to **independent, authoritative sources** in control theory and optimization. --- ## BibTeX System Questions ### Q5: Why are there 94 BibTeX entries but only 39 documentation citations? **Answer:** The 94 entries provide a **bibliography** covering:
- **39 actively cited** in documentation (`docs/theory/*.md`)
- **39 cited in controller docstrings** (`src/controllers/*.py`)
- **Remaining entries** - Related work for context and future citations **Breakdown:**
- SMC theory: 35 entries (22 actively cited)
- PSO optimization: 22 entries (13 actively cited)
- DIP dynamics: 8 entries (4 actively cited)
- Adaptive control: 7 entries (2 actively cited)
- Stability theory: 6 entries (varied)
- Fault detection: 7 entries (minimal active use)
- Numerical methods: 5 entries (background)
- Software engineering: 4 entries (implementation) This follows best practice of maintaining a **complete bibliography** even if not all entries are actively cited in the current version. --- ### Q6: How are BibTeX keys structured? **Answer:** **Format:** `{topic}_{author}_{year}_{descriptor}` **Examples:**
- `smc_levant_2003_higher_order_sliding_modes` - SMC topic, Levant author, 2003
- `pso_kennedy_eberhart_1995_pso_original` - PSO topic, Kennedy & Eberhart, 1995
- `dip_block_2007_dip_benchmark` - DIP topic, Block et al., 2007 **Benefits:**
- **Self-documenting** - Key describes content
- **Sortable** - Alphabetical by topic, then author
- **Unique** - Avoid collisions with descriptive suffixes
- **Grep-friendly** - Easy to search: `grep "smc_levant" docs/bib/*.bib` --- ### Q7: What citation format is used? **Answer:** **MyST Markdown** with inline citations: ```markdown
The super-twisting algorithm ensures finite-time convergence
{cite}`smc_levant_2003_higher_order_sliding_modes`.
``` **Multiple citations:**
```markdown
Classical SMC achieves finite-time reaching
{cite}`smc_utkin_2009,smc_edwards_spurgeon_1998,smc_slotine_li_1991`.
``` **Bibliography generation:** Sphinx/MyST automatically generates bibliography from BibTeX **Advantages:**
- Standard academic format
- Automated bibliography
- Cross-referencing support
- Export to multiple formats (see Q13) --- ## Theorem Citation Questions ### Q8: How do I verify a specific theorem citation? **Answer:** **Step-by-step verification for FORMAL-THEOREM-021 (Super-Twisting):** 1. **Locate theorem:** `.artifacts/citation_mapping.json` ```json { "FORMAL-THEOREM-021": { "theorem": "Super-twisting algorithm ensures finite-time convergence...", "citations": [ "smc_levant_2003_higher_order_introduction", "smc_moreno_2008_lyapunov_sta", "smc_seeber_2017_sta_parameter_setting" ] } } ``` 2. **Read BibTeX:** `docs/bib/smc.bib` ```bibtex @article{smc_levant_2003_higher_order_introduction, title = {Higher-order sliding modes, differentiation and output-feedback control}, author = {Levant, Arie}, doi = {10.1080/0020717031000099029}, note = {Super-twisting algorithm, finite-time convergence, continuous control} } ``` 3. **Check theorem statement:** `docs/theory/smc_theory_complete.md:L206` 4. **Verify code:** `src/controllers/smc/sta_smc.py:L50-100` 5. **Run test:** `pytest tests/test_controllers/test_sta_smc.py::test_second_order_sliding_convergence` **Reference:** `docs/for_reviewers/theorem_verification_guide.md` --- ### Q9: What if I find a citation that seems inaccurate? **Answer:** **Current status:** Mean accuracy 99.1% (11/11 theorems PASS) **One minor enhancement opportunity identified:**
- **FORMAL-THEOREM-004** - PSO global asymptotic stability
- Current citations appropriate but could be enhanced with additional Lyapunov-based source
- Not critical - existing citations adequately support claim **If you find an issue:**
1. Check `.artifacts/accuracy_audit.md` - may already be documented
2. Verify BibTeX `note` field - may clarify context
3. Check if citation is for **general methodology** vs. **specific theorem**
4. Contact authors with specific concern **We welcome feedback!** GitHub Issues: https://github.com/theSadeQ/dip-smc-pso/issues --- ### Q10: How are theorem-to-code mappings maintained? **Answer:** **Authoritative mapping:** `.artifacts/citation_mapping.json` **Structure:**
```json
{ "FORMAL-THEOREM-{ID}": { "id": "FORMAL-THEOREM-{ID}", "theorem": "Full theorem statement", "citations": ["key1", "key2", "key3"], "locations": [ { "file": "docs/theory/smc_theory_complete.md", "context": "Theorem 1 (Surface Stability)", "line_approx": "L71" }, { "file": "src/controllers/smc/classic_smc.py", "context": "Sliding surface design docstring", "line_approx": "~L50-80" } ] }
}
``` **Maintenance:**
- **Line numbers** are approximate (code changes)
- **Context** helps locate even if lines shift
- **Verification:** `grep -n "Theorem 1" docs/theory/smc_theory_complete.md` --- ## Attribution Questions ### Q11: Why are there 133 "high-severity" uncited claims? **Answer:** **Context is critical!** The attribution checker flagged 1,144 total claims, but: **Breakdown:**
- **75% concentrated in 5 theory files** (manageable scope)
- **Theory files already have 39 citations** (many flags are proximity issues)
- **Phase reports** - Project documentation, not academic claims (no citations needed)
- **API documentation** - Implementation details, not theoretical assertions **Specific files:**
- `lyapunov_stability_analysis.md` (37) - **Needs numerical analysis citations** (Golub & Van Loan)
- `smc_theory_complete.md` (24) - **Already has 22 citations**, proximity issue
- `numerical_stability_methods.md` (20) - **Needs Trefethen & Bau references** **Assessment:** CONDITIONAL PASS - strong existing coverage, minor additions recommended **Report:** `.artifacts/attribution_audit_executive_summary.md` --- ### Q12: Are there any direct quotes from cited sources? **Answer:** **No direct quotes.** All content is:
- **Paraphrased** - Restated in project-specific terminology
- **Adapted** - Modified for double inverted pendulum application
- **Original proofs** - Simplified for implementation context
- **Code-specific** - Translated from mathematical notation to Python **Verification approach:**
- **Theorem statements** - Match mathematical conditions from sources
- **Proof sketches** - Simplified versions with citations to full proofs
- **Implementation** - Original code based on cited algorithms **No plagiarism risk** - All content is original technical writing with proper attribution. --- ## Export and Integration Questions ### Q13: Can I export citations to EndNote/Zotero/Mendeley? **Answer:** **Yes!** We provide multiple export formats: **BibTeX (native):**
```bash
# All citations
cat docs/bib/*.bib > combined_bibliography.bib
``` **RIS format (EndNote, Mendeley):**
```bash
