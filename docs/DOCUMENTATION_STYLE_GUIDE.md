# Documentation Style Guide

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-09
**Status:** Official Project Standard

---

## Purpose

This guide defines professional writing standards for the DIP-SMC-PSO project documentation based on lessons learned from comprehensive quality audits. Following these standards ensures documentation sounds human-written, professional, and technically accurate.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Direct, not conversational** - Get to the point immediately
2. **Specific, not generic** - Show concrete features, not abstract claims
3. **Technical, not marketing** - Facts over enthusiasm
4. **Show, don't tell** - Concrete examples over buzzwords
5. **Cite, don't hype** - References over marketing language

---

## AI-ish Anti-Patterns (AVOID)

### Greeting & Conversational Language

❌ **DO NOT USE:**
- "Let's explore...", "Let us examine..."
- "You'll love..."
- "In this section we will..."
- "Now let's look at..."

✅ **USE INSTEAD:**
- Direct topic sentence: "The PSO optimizer minimizes..."
- "This section covers..."
- "The following demonstrates..."

### Enthusiasm & Marketing Buzzwords

❌ **DO NOT USE:**
- "framework" (unless backed by metrics)
- "capabilities"
- "integration"
- "algorithms (see references)" (without citations)
- "state-of-the-art" (without citations)
- "reliable implementation" (use specific reliability features)

✅ **USE INSTEAD:**
- "framework" (let features speak)
- List specific capabilities
- "integration" (describe, don't hype)
- "PSO optimization (Kennedy & Eberhart, 1995)"
- "Achieves 30% faster convergence vs baseline"
- "Handles edge cases A, B, C"

### Hedge Words

❌ **DO NOT USE:**
- "use the power of" → ✅ "use"
- "use the optimizer" → ✅ "use the optimizer"
- "examine the details" → ✅ "examine", "analyze"
- "enable testing" → ✅ "enables testing" or be specific

### Unnecessary Transitions

❌ **DO NOT USE:**
- "..." (redundant)
- "It's worth noting that..." (remove or integrate)
- "Additionally, it should be mentioned..." (verbose)
- "Furthermore, we observe that..." (simplify)

✅ **USE INSTEAD:**
- Remove entirely or state directly
- "The results show..."
- "Additionally," (shorter)
- "The data shows..."

## Professional Writing Examples

### GOOD: Technical Description

```
The PSO optimizer minimizes the cost function using particle swarm dynamics.
Each particle represents a candidate gain set, converging to optimal parameters
through velocity updates guided by personal best and global best positions.
```

**Why this works:**
- Direct, factual statements
- Technical terminology used correctly
- No marketing fluff

### BAD: AI-ish Description

```
This section covers the powerful PSO optimizer with its comprehensive capabilities!
how seamlessly it uses cutting-edge particle swarm dynamics
to deliver amazing optimization results through techniques (see references)!
```

**Why this fails:**
- Conversational greeting ("Let's")
- Marketing buzzwords ("powerful", "comprehensive", "seamless", "cutting-edge")
- No specific technical information
- Over-enthusiastic tone

---

### GOOD: Procedure Documentation

```
Controller gains are tuned using the following procedure:

1. Define parameter bounds in config.yaml
2. Run PSO optimization: python simulate.py --run-pso
3. Validate results against acceptance criteria
4. Update config with optimized gains
```

**Why this works:**
- Clear, numbered steps
- Specific commands
- No filler language

### BAD: AI-ish Procedure

```
In this comprehensive section, we will examine the exciting world of
controller tuning! our robust framework facilitates
seamless parameter optimization through powerful PSO techniques that uses advanced capabilities.
```

**Why this fails:**
- No actual procedural information
- All filler, no content
- Marketing language instead of instructions

---

### GOOD: Performance Claims

```
The adaptive SMC achieves:
- Settling time: 2.1 ± 0.3 seconds
- RMSE: 0.012 rad
- Control effort: 15.3 N (mean)

Performance validated across 10,000 Monte Carlo trials.
```

**Why this works:**
- Quantified metrics
- Statistical confidence intervals
- Validation method specified

### BAD: AI-ish Claims

```
Our revolutionary adaptive SMC delivers amazing performance with industry-leading
settling times and best-in-class accuracy through powerful control algorithms!
```

**Why this fails:**
- No actual numbers
- Unsubstantiated claims
- Marketing superlatives

## File-Specific Guidelines

### Getting Started Guides

**Replace:**
- "Let's get started with..."
- "how easy it is to..."

**With:**
- "This guide covers installation and basic usage."
- "Quick start: Install dependencies → Configure → Run simulation"

### Tutorials

**Replace:**
- "In this tutorial, we will explore..."
- "Let's learn how to..."

**With:**
- "This tutorial demonstrates PSO parameter tuning."
- "Learn to configure test suites and validate performance."

### API Reference

**Guidelines:**
- Keep technical terminology (even if it sounds "robust" in context)
- Remove all marketing language
- Preserve mathematical rigor
- Use formal parameter descriptions

**Example:**
```python
def compute_control(state, gains, boundary_layer):
    """
    Compute SMC control output.

    Args:
        state: System state [x, θ₁, θ₂, ẋ, θ̇₁, θ̇₂]
        gains: Controller gains [λ₁, λ₂, λ₃, λ₄, K, Φ]
        boundary_layer: Boundary layer thickness (rad)

    Returns:
        Control force (N), bounded by max_force
    """
```

### Theory Guides

**Guidelines:**
- Formal academic tone
- Citation-driven claims
- Mathematical notation for precision
- Proof-based stability arguments

**Example:**
```
Sliding Mode Control ensures finite-time convergence to the sliding surface
s = λ₁e + λ₂ė = 0 under Assumption 2.1 (bounded disturbances). The control
law u = -(K + Φ)|s| · sgn(s) guarantees reaching condition ṡ · s ≤ -η|s|
for η > 0 (Utkin, 1992).
```

---

## Context-Aware Exceptions

### When Technical Terms Are Acceptable

These terms are acceptable when used in proper technical context:

- **"robust control"** - Formal control theory term (H∞ robustness, μ-synthesis)
- **"comprehensive test coverage: 95%"** - Backed by metrics
- **"enable logging"** - Software configuration terminology
- **"advanced MPC"** - Distinguishing from basic variants

**Rule:** If it has a precise technical definition, it's acceptable. If it's marketing fluff, remove it.

### When "Let's" Is Acceptable

In interactive tutorial contexts (Jupyter notebooks, live demos):

```python
# Interactive Jupyter notebook cell
# Let's run a quick simulation to see the controller response
result = simulate(controller, duration=5.0)
plot(result)
```

This mirrors natural teaching flow in interactive environments.
