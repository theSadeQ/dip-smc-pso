## Overview

The theoretical foundation of this work rests on three pillars:

1. **Nonlinear System Modeling**: First-principles derivation of the double-inverted pendulum dynamics
2. **Robust Control Theory**: Sliding mode control with finite-time convergence guarantees
3. **Optimization Theory**: Particle swarm optimization for automated parameter tuning

The mathematical framework ensures that all control designs have rigorous stability guarantees while maintaining practical implementability.

## Key Mathematical Results

The main theoretical contributions include:

- Complete nonlinear dynamics model with $n=3$ degrees of freedom
- Lyapunov-based stability proof for finite-time convergence in {eq}`eq:lyapunov_stability`
- Chattering-free control via super-twisting algorithms in {eq}`eq:supertwisting_law`
- Optimal gain selection through constrained PSO optimization in {eq}`eq:pso_objective`
