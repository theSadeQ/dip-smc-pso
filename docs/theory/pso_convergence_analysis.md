# PSO Convergence Analysis

**Note:** PSO convergence analysis has been integrated into the comprehensive PSO theory documentation.

## Convergence Analysis Topics

For detailed PSO convergence analysis, refer to:

- **Primary Documentation:** [theory/pso_optimization_complete.md](./pso_optimization_complete.md)
- **Mathematical Foundations:** [mathematical_foundations/pso_algorithm_theory.md](../mathematical_foundations/pso_algorithm_theory.md)
- **Validation Framework:** [optimization/validation/enhanced_convergence_analyzer.md](../reference/optimization/validation_enhanced_convergence_analyzer.md)

## Quick Reference

### Convergence Criteria

1. **Fitness-based:** `|f_best(t) - f_best(t-k)| < ε` for k consecutive iterations
2. **Position-based:** `max||x_i(t) - x_i(t-1)|| < δ` across all particles
3. **Velocity-based:** `mean||v_i(t)|| < γ` indicates convergence

### Convergence Detection

The enhanced convergence analyzer provides:
- Multi-criteria convergence detection
- Early stopping mechanisms
- Convergence diagnostics
- Stagnation detection

### Implementation

See `src/optimization/validation/enhanced_convergence_analyzer.py` for:
- Real-time convergence monitoring
- Statistical validation
- Convergence quality assessment

For complete mathematical theory and empirical analysis, see [PSO Optimization Complete Theory](./pso_optimization_complete.md).
