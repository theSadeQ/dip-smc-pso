# Examples

This section provides example code and usage patterns for the double-inverted pendulum control system.

## Status: Sphinx-Gallery Integration

**Current Status:** Deferred (not implemented)

The automatic examples gallery using Sphinx-Gallery is planned but not yet implemented. This decision was made to prioritize:
- Research validation (Phase 5, completed November 7, 2025)
- Controller benchmarking and documentation
- Research paper preparation

**Alternative:** See existing examples in:
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks with interactive examples
- `scripts/` - Standalone Python scripts demonstrating key features
- Tutorial documentation with code snippets

**Future Plans:** Sphinx-Gallery integration will be reconsidered based on:
- User demand for auto-generated example galleries
- Maintenance overhead vs. benefits
- Availability of development resources
