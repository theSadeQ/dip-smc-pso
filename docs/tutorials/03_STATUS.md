# Tutorial 03 Status - PSO Optimization Deep Dive

## Current Status

**Phase:** Planned (not yet implemented)
**Last Updated:** November 8, 2025
**Completion:** 0% (placeholder only)

---

## What Exists

The file `03_pso_optimization_deep_dive.md` currently contains:

- [OK] Outline of planned content (4 sections)
- [OK] Links to existing PSO documentation
- [OK] Basic PSO command examples

**What it does NOT contain:**
- [MISSING] Detailed PSO theory walkthroughs
- [MISSING] Multi-objective optimization examples
- [MISSING] Advanced technique implementations
- [MISSING] Complete practical workflows
- [MISSING] Troubleshooting sections
- [MISSING] Performance comparison studies

---

## Why It's Incomplete

Tutorial 03 was planned for **Phase 7** of the documentation roadmap. The project completed:
- Phase 3: UI/UX (October 9-17, 2025)
- Phase 4: Production readiness (October 2025)
- Phase 5: Research phase (October 29 - November 7, 2025)

Tutorial 03 development was deferred to focus on:
1. Research validation (11/11 research tasks completed)
2. Controller benchmarking and optimization
3. Research paper preparation (LT-7, submission-ready)

## Alternatives (Use These Instead)

While Tutorial 03 remains a placeholder, complete PSO documentation exists elsewhere:

### 1. PSO Theory & Implementation
- **File:** `docs/theory/pso_optimization_complete.md`
- **Coverage:** Mathematical foundations, algorithm details, convergence analysis
- **Audience:** Researchers and advanced users

### 2. PSO Integration Guide
- **File:** `docs/factory/enhanced_pso_integration_guide.md`
- **Coverage:** Factory patterns, gain bounds, validation, practical integration
- **Audience:** Developers integrating PSO with controllers

### 3. Optimization Workflow Guide
- **File:** `docs/optimization_simulation/guide.md`
- **Coverage:** End-to-end optimization workflows, simulation parameters
- **Audience:** Users running PSO optimizations

### 4. Case Studies
- **File:** `docs/issue_12_pso_optimization_report.md`
- **Coverage:** Real-world PSO optimization example with results analysis
- **Audience:** Users wanting practical examples

## Quick Start Examples

### Basic PSO Optimization
```bash
# Optimize classical SMC gains
python simulate.py --ctrl classical_smc --run-pso --save gains_classical.json

# Optimize adaptive SMC gains
python simulate.py --ctrl adaptive_smc --run-pso --save gains_adaptive.json

# Optimize with custom seed for reproducibility
python simulate.py --ctrl sta_smc --run-pso --seed 42 --save gains_sta.json
```

### Advanced Chattering Reduction
```bash
# Use dedicated optimization script
python scripts/optimization/optimize_chattering_reduction.py --controller adaptive_smc
```

### Load and Test Optimized Gains
```bash
# Test optimized gains
python simulate.py --load gains_classical.json --plot
```

## Future Plans

Tutorial 03 completion is planned but not scheduled. Priority depends on:
- User demand for beginner-friendly PSO content
- Availability of development resources
- Completion of higher-priority documentation

**Estimated effort:** 8-12 hours to write complete tutorial
**Target audience:** Intermediate users (familiar with basic SMC, want to master PSO)
