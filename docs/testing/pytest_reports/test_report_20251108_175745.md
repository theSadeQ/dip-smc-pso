## Quality Gates

[ERROR] Quality gate violations detected:


### Blocking Issues

- [ERROR] Test pass rate 0.0% below threshold 95.0%
- [ERROR] overall_coverage 0.0% below threshold 85.0%
- [ERROR] critical_coverage 0.0% below threshold 95.0%
- [ERROR] safety_coverage 0.0% below threshold 100.0%
- [ERROR] branch_coverage 0.0% below threshold 80.0%

## Recommendations

- [INFO] Address quality gate violations before production deployment
- [INFO] Increase test coverage with focus on critical components
- [INFO] Run performance benchmarks to detect regressions
- [INFO] Validate numerical stability across all controllers
- [INFO] Monitor memory usage in optimization algorithms
