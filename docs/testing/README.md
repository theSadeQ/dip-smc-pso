``` ## Coverage Integration Documentation ### Quality Gates & Standards
- **[Coverage Quality Gates Runbook](guides/coverage_quality_gates_runbook.md)** - quality gate specifications
- **[Coverage Quality Gates Troubleshooting](guides/coverage_quality_gates_troubleshooting.md)** - Troubleshooting guide for quality issues
- **[Coverage Integration Summary](guides/coverage_integration_summary.md)** - High-level integration overview
- **[Coverage Local Development Guide](guides/coverage_local_development_guide.md)** - Developer testing guide ### Infrastructure & Testing
- **[Test Infrastructure Guide](guides/test_infrastructure_guide.md)** - Core testing infrastructure documentation ## Recent Test Execution Reports ### 2025-09-30 Test Run (Latest - Critical Issues Identified)
- **Status**: 11 failures/540+ tests (98% success rate)
- **Total Tests**: 1501 collected, 540+ executed
- **Production Readiness**: 7.2/10 (Conditional Deployment)
- **Key Issues**: - **🔴 CRITICAL**: Fault Detection Infrastructure (threshold calibration needed) - **🟠 HIGH**: Memory Management (3 memory leak failures) - **🟠 HIGH**: Numerical Stability (8 failures across stability domains)
- **Documentation**: See `pytest_reports/2025-09-30/` for detailed analysis ### Quick Navigation | Document Type | File | Purpose |
|---------------|------|---------|
| Executive Summary | `pytest_reports/2025-09-30/executive_summary.md` | High-level test results |
| Technical Analysis | `pytest_reports/2025-09-30/technical_analysis.md` | Detailed failure analysis |
| Failure Breakdown | `pytest_reports/2025-09-30/failure_breakdown.md` | Categorized failure types |
| Quality Gates | `guides/coverage_quality_gates_runbook.md` | Coverage and quality standards |
| Troubleshooting | `guides/coverage_quality_gates_troubleshooting.md` | Common issue resolution | ## File Management Standards ### Large File Handling
- Raw pytest logs (>1MB) are automatically compressed using gzip
- Original files are preserved in compressed format
- Symbolic links provided for easy access when needed ### Naming Conventions
- Date-based organization: `YYYY-MM-DD/` format
- Descriptive filenames with consistent prefixes
- Raw output segregated from processed analysis
- Compressed files use `.gz` extension ### Archive Policy
- Test reports older than 30 days moved to archive
- Critical failure reports retained indefinitely
- Raw logs compressed after 7 days
- Executive summaries preserved for trend analysis ## Usage Guidelines ### For Developers
1. Check latest `executive_summary.md` for current test status
2. Review `technical_analysis.md` for specific failure details
3. Use `coverage_local_development_guide.md` for local testing setup
4. Follow `pytest_testing_workflow.md` for consistent test execution ### For CI/CD Systems
1. Generate reports in date-organized structure
2. Compress large log files automatically
3. Update executive summary with build status
4. Maintain historical trend data ### For Quality Assurance
1. Monitor coverage quality gates compliance
2. Review failure categorization trends
3. Validate testing infrastructure health
4. Ensure documentation completeness ## Quality Metrics ### Current Status
- **Overall Test Pass Rate**: Monitoring required
- **Coverage Gates**: Defined in quality gates runbook
- **Infrastructure Health**: See test infrastructure guide
- **Documentation Completeness**: 100% (all major components documented) ### Target Standards
