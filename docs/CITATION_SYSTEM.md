# Citation System Documentation **Status:** To be completed in Phase B (Citation System Implementation)
**Est. Completion:** Week 10 of Phase B --- ## Overview This document will provide documentation of the citation system implementation, covering the automated extraction, research, integration, and validation processes. ## Planned Content ### 1. System Architecture
- Citation extraction pipeline
- AI-powered research automation
- Citation integration workflow
- Validation and quality assurance ### 2. Implementation Details
- Claim extraction methodology (500+ claims)
- API integrations (Semantic Scholar, ArXiv, CrossRef)
- Citation insertion automation
- Quality metrics and validation ### 3. Usage Guide
- Running citation extraction
- Executing research pipeline
- Inserting citations into documentation
- Validating citation quality ### 4. Quality Metrics
- Total references: 150-200 (target)
- DOI accessibility: ≥95%
- Citation coverage: ≥85%
- Format consistency: 100% ## Implementation Phases The citation system will be implemented in 5 phases: ### Phase 1: Claim Extraction Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
- Extract 500+ claims from documentation and code
- Categorize by priority (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM)
- Generate research queue ### Phase 2: AI Research Automation (Week 3-4)
- Semantic Scholar + ArXiv + CrossRef integration
- Parallel API searches with rate limiting
- Generate 150-200 BibTeX entries ### Phase 3: Citation Integration (Week 5-7)
- Insert citations into documentation files
- Update code docstrings with references
- Automated citation formatting ### Phase 4: Validation & Quality (Week 8)
- DOI accessibility validation
- Duplicate detection and resolution
- Style consistency enforcement
- Coverage analysis ### Phase 5: Final Review & Publication (Week 9-10)
- Academic accuracy review
- Attribution completeness audit
- Peer review preparation
- Academic integrity certification ## Current Tools The following tools will be developed: ### Extraction Tools
