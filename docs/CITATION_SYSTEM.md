# Citation System Documentation

**Status:** Phase B Deferred (Research phase prioritized)

**Current State:** Planning complete, implementation deferred pending research completion

---

## Overview

This project includes comprehensive planning for an automated citation system that will add 150-200 academic references to the documentation. While full implementation is deferred, the planning infrastructure is complete and ready for execution when research priorities allow.

### How to Cite This Project

If you use this Double Inverted Pendulum SMC/PSO framework in your research, please cite:

```bibtex
@software{dip_smc_pso_2024,
  title = {DIP\_SMC\_PSO: Double Inverted Pendulum Sliding Mode Control with PSO Optimization},
  author = {Research Team},
  year = {2024},
  url = {https://github.com/theSadeQ/dip-smc-pso},
  version = {1.0.0}
}
```

### Existing Citation Resources

- **[CITATIONS.md](CITATIONS.md)** - Manual citations and references

- API integrations (Semantic Scholar, ArXiv, CrossRef)
- Citation insertion automation
- Quality metrics and validation ### 3. Usage Guide
- Running citation extraction
- Executing research pipeline
- Inserting citations into documentation
- Validating citation quality ### 4. Quality Metrics
- Total references: 150-200 (target)
- DOI accessibility: ≥95%
- Citation coverage: ≥85%
- Format consistency: 100% ## Implementation Phases The citation system will be implemented in 5 phases: ### Phase 1: Claim Extraction Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
- Extract 500+ claims from documentation and code
- Categorize by priority (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM)
- Generate research queue ### Phase 2: AI Research Automation (Week 3-4)
- Semantic Scholar + ArXiv + CrossRef integration
- Parallel API searches with rate limiting
- Generate 150-200 BibTeX entries ### Phase 3: Citation Integration (Week 5-7)
- Insert citations into documentation files
- Update code docstrings with references
- Automated citation formatting ### Phase 4: Validation & Quality (Week 8)
- DOI accessibility validation
- Duplicate detection and resolution
- Style consistency enforcement
- Coverage analysis ### Phase 5: Final Review & Publication (Week 9-10)
- Academic accuracy review
- Attribution completeness audit
- Peer review preparation
- Academic integrity certification ## Current Tools The following tools will be developed: ### Extraction Tools
