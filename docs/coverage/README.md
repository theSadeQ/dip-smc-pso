# Coverage Analysis & Quality Gates This document describes the coverage analysis system and quality gates implementation for the DIP-SMC-PSO project. ## Current Coverage Status **Overall Coverage**: 25.9% ➜ **Target**: 85%

**Critical Components**: TBD ➜ **Target**: 95%
**Safety-Critical**: TBD ➜ **Target**: 100% ## Coverage Categories ### Critical Components (95% Required)
- **Controllers** (`src/controllers/`): Control system implementations - Classical SMC, STA-SMC, Adaptive SMC, Hybrid Adaptive STA-SMC - Controller factory and configuration management
- **Core** (`src/core/`): Simulation engine and dynamics models - Simulation runner, dynamics models, integration algorithms
- **Optimization** (`src/optimization/`): PSO and optimization workflows - PSO algorithms, fitness functions, convergence analysis ### Safety-Critical Components (100% Required)
- **SMC Core** (`src/controllers/smc/core/`): Core SMC algorithms - Sliding surface computation, equivalent control, gain validation
- **Validation** (`src/utils/validation/`): Safety and validation systems - Input validation, constraint checking, safety monitors
- **Plant Safety** (`src/plant/safety/`): Safety constraint enforcement - Physical limits, safety interlocks, emergency procedures ## Quality Gate Commands ### Full Coverage Analysis
```bash
# Generate coverage reports
python -m pytest tests/ \ --cov=src \ --cov-report=html:validation/htmlcov \ --cov-report=xml:validation/coverage.xml \ --cov-report=json:validation/coverage.json \ --cov-report=term-missing
``` ### Quality Gate Validation

```bash
# Run all quality gates with threshold enforcement
python scripts/run_quality_gates.py --output validation/quality_gates.json # Coverage-specific threshold validation
python scripts/coverage_validator.py \ --coverage-xml validation/coverage.xml \ --fail-below-threshold \ --output-json validation/coverage_metrics.json
``` ### CI Integration

```bash
# CI-ready validation sequence
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=xml:coverage.xml --cov-fail-under=85
python scripts/coverage_validator.py --coverage-xml coverage.xml --fail-below-threshold
``` ## Reports and Artifacts - **HTML Report**: `validation/htmlcov/index.html` - Interactive coverage visualization

- **XML Report**: `validation/coverage.xml` - Machine-readable coverage data
- **JSON Report**: `validation/coverage.json` - Detailed coverage metrics
- **Quality Gates**: `validation/quality_gates.json` - Pass/fail status for all gates
- **Coverage Metrics**: `validation/coverage_metrics.json` - Threshold validation results ## Quality Gate Integration ### Automated Quality Gates
The project implements automated quality gates that must pass for production deployment: 1. **Test Suite Execution**: All tests must pass
2. **Coverage Thresholds**: Meet minimum coverage requirements
3. **Code Quality**: Pass linting and type checking
4. **Performance**: No regression in benchmark tests
5. **Documentation**: Coverage procedures documented ### Manual Quality Review
Beyond automated gates, manual review ensures:
- Test quality and comprehensiveness
- Coverage of edge cases and error paths
- Integration test completeness
- Documentation accuracy and clarity ### Continuous Improvement
Coverage metrics are tracked over time to ensure continuous improvement:
- Weekly coverage trend analysis
- Coverage gap identification and prioritization
- Test enhancement recommendations
- Quality gate threshold adjustments based on project maturity
