# Robust PSO Methodology: Multi-Scenario Optimization for Overfitting Prevention

## Research Context

This document describes the robust PSO methodology implemented to address MT-7 Issue (50.4x chattering degradation when standard PSO-tuned gains are tested on realistic conditions). This work extends the PSO-based gain tuning framework described in the main thesis with a multi-scenario optimization approach.

## 1. Problem Statement: Overfitting in Standard PSO

### 1.1 The Overfitting Phenomenon

Standard PSO optimizes controller gains by evaluating fitness on a single nominal initial condition (typically ±0.05 rad angular perturbations). While this produces excellent performance on training conditions, it suffers from severe performance degradation when deployed on diverse operational scenarios:

**Observed Degradation (MT-7 Issue):**
- Training condition: ±0.05 rad initial angles → Low chattering (nominal)
- Test condition: ±0.3 rad initial angles → 50-150x chattering increase
- Root cause: Gains optimized for narrow operational envelope

**Analogy to Machine Learning:**
Standard PSO exhibits classic overfitting: the optimizer finds gains that exploit specific characteristics of the training IC rather than learning generalizable control policies. This is analogous to deep learning models that memorize training data rather than learning robust features.

### 1.2 Real-World Implications

In practical deployment, systems encounter:
- Diverse initial conditions (startup transients, disturbances, state estimation errors)
- Parameter variations (wear, temperature effects, payload changes)
- Sensor noise and actuator dynamics

Controllers tuned on single nominal ICs fail catastrophically under these realistic conditions, rendering them unsuitable for production deployment despite theoretical optimality.

## 2. Robust PSO Solution: Multi-Scenario Fitness Evaluation

### 2.1 Core Methodology

Robust PSO evaluates each candidate gain vector across N_scenarios diverse initial conditions spanning the operational envelope:

```
Standard PSO:    J_standard = cost(gains, IC_nominal)

Robust PSO:      scenarios = generate_scenarios(config)
                 costs = [cost(gains, IC_i) for IC_i in scenarios]
                 J_robust = mean(costs) + α × max(costs)
```

**Key Innovation:** The fitness function combines average performance (mean) with worst-case performance (max), controlled by robustness parameter α ∈ [0, 1].

### 2.2 Scenario Generation Strategy

Default configuration employs 15 diverse scenarios with strategic distribution:

| Scenario Type | Count | Angle Range | Weight | Rationale |
|---------------|-------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Nominal       | 3     | ±0.05 rad   | 20%    | Maintain baseline performance |
| Moderate      | 4     | ±0.15 rad   | 30%    | Intermediate robustness |
| Large         | 8     | ±0.30 rad   | 50%    | Emphasize real-world disturbances |

**Distribution Rationale:**
- 50% weight on large disturbances reflects real-world operational emphasis
- 20% nominal weight prevents complete sacrifice of baseline performance
- Asymmetric distribution biases optimizer toward robustness over nominal optimality

**Angular Ranges:**
- ±0.05 rad (~±3°): Similar to standard PSO training conditions
- ±0.15 rad (~±9°): Moderate state estimation errors or small disturbances
- ±0.30 rad (~±17°): Large disturbances, startup transients, severe noise

### 2.3 Robust Fitness Function

```math
J_robust = (1/N) Σ cost_i + α × max(cost_1, ..., cost_N)
```

**Components:**
- **Mean term:** Encourages average performance across all scenarios
- **Max term:** Penalizes worst-case failures, prevents gains that excel on some scenarios but catastrophically fail on others
- **α parameter:** Trade-off knob (default: 0.3)
  - α = 0.0: Pure average (equal weight to all scenarios)
  - α = 0.3: Balanced (30% weight on worst case)
  - α = 1.0: Conservative (worst case dominates)

**Design Choice:** α = 0.3 provides good balance between average and worst-case performance based on empirical validation.

## 3. Implementation Architecture

### 3.1 System Components

**1. RobustCostEvaluator** (`src/optimization/core/robust_cost_evaluator.py`):
- Generates scenario ICs based on configuration weights
- Evaluates batch simulations across all scenarios
- Computes robust cost with mean + α × max aggregation
- Handles failure penalties and edge cases

**2. RobustPSOTuner** (`src/optimization/pso/robust_tuner.py`):
- Wrapper around standard PSOTuner
- Replaces single-IC cost evaluator with RobustCostEvaluator
- Maintains identical PSO dynamics (inertia, cognitive/social coefficients)
- CLI integration via `--robust-pso` flag

**3. Configuration Schema** (`config.yaml`):
```yaml
pso:
  robustness:
    enabled: false  # Activated via CLI flag
    scenario_weights:
      nominal: 0.20
      moderate: 0.30
      large: 0.50
    nominal_angle_range: 0.05
    moderate_angle_range: 0.15
    large_angle_range: 0.30
    robustness_alpha: 0.3
```

### 3.2 Computational Complexity

**Time Complexity:**
- Standard PSO: O(P × I × T) where P = particles, I = iterations, T = simulation time
- Robust PSO: O(P × I × N × T) where N = scenarios (15)
- **Overhead:** 15x computational cost per PSO iteration

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Vectorized batch simulation (`simulate_system_batch`) evaluates multiple scenarios in parallel
- Reduced PSO iterations for quick tests (100-200 vs 500+)
- Early termination for infeasible particles (divergent simulations)

## 4. Validation Methodology (MT-7 Protocol)

### 4.1 Experimental Design

**Objective:** Quantify robustness improvement of robust PSO vs standard PSO

**Protocol:**
1. Train standard PSO gains on nominal IC (±0.05 rad)
2. Train robust PSO gains on 15 diverse scenarios
3. Test both gain sets on 500 runs each for:
   - Nominal conditions (±0.05 rad)
   - Realistic conditions (±0.30 rad)
4. Compute chattering index, degradation ratios, statistical significance

**Metrics:**
- **Chattering Index:** Variance of control rate (du/dt), quantifies high-frequency oscillations
- **Degradation Ratio:** chattering_realistic / chattering_nominal
- **Target:** <5x degradation (vs 50-150x for standard PSO)
- **Improvement Factor:** standard_degradation / robust_degradation

### 4.2 Statistical Analysis

**Sample Size:** 500 runs per condition (2,000 total simulations)
- Sufficient for 95% confidence intervals with ±5% error margin
- Welch's t-test for comparing distributions (unequal variances)
- Effect size: Cohen's d for practical significance

**Randomization:**
- Fixed seed for reproducibility (seed = 42)
- Uniformly distributed initial angles within specified ranges
- Zero initial velocities, cart at origin

2. **Absolute Performance:** 94% chattering reduction on realistic conditions (115k → 6.9k)
3. **Consistency:** Robust PSO shows tighter confidence intervals (more predictable)
4. **Target Status:** Partially met (19.28x > 5x target, but substantial progress)

### 5.2 Statistical Significance

**Welch's t-test (Realistic Conditions):**
- Standard vs Robust: t = 5.34, p < 0.001 (highly significant)
- Effect size: Cohen's d = 0.53 (medium-large practical difference)
- Conclusion: Improvement is statistically robust, not due to random variation

### 5.3 Success Rates

**Observation:** Both standard and robust PSO showed 0% success rates (stabilization within ±0.05 rad)

**Analysis:**
- Indicates both gain sets struggle with full stabilization
- Chattering reduction achieved without improving settling performance
- Suggests need for:
  - Refined cost function (increase settling time weight)
  - Alternative controller architectures (STA-SMC, hybrid adaptive)
  - Higher PSO iteration counts (500+ vs 200)

- PSO: 30 particles, 200 iterations, c1=2.0, c2=2.0, w=0.7
- Robustness: α=0.3, 15 scenarios (20% nominal, 30% moderate, 50% large)
- Simulation: dt=0.01s, T=5.0s, u_max=150N
- Cost weights: state=50.0, control=0.2, control_rate=0.1, stability=0.1

## 8. Conclusion

Robust PSO successfully addresses the overfitting problem in sliding mode control gain tuning, achieving a 7.5x reduction in chattering degradation compared to standard PSO. While the absolute <5x target remains unmet, the infrastructure is operational, validated, and ready for further parameter tuning and controller architecture exploration.

The multi-scenario optimization framework represents a generalizable approach to controller with error handling design, applicable beyond SMC to any control paradigm where overfitting to training conditions threatens real-world performance.
