## VI. APPENDIX: MATHEMATICAL REFERENCE

### Key Theorems Commonly Used in Proofs

**Lyapunov Stability Theorem**: If V(x) > 0 for x ≠ 0 and V̇(x) ≤ 0 for all x in neighborhood of origin, then origin is stable. If V̇(x) < 0 (strictly), then asymptotically stable.

**LaSalle Invariance Principle**: If V is bounded and V̇ ≤ 0, trajectories converge to largest invariant set contained in {x: V̇ = 0}.

**Barbalat's Lemma**: If f is uniformly continuous and ∫₀^∞ f(t)dt converges, then f(t) → 0 as t → ∞.

**Clarke Generalized Derivative** (for non-smooth functions): Generalization of derivative for Lipschitz continuous functions. For piecewise smooth functions, directional derivatives along different "pieces" must be bounded.

**Finite-Time Lyapunov Theorem**: Under certain homogeneity conditions, if V̇ ≤ -cVᵅ with 0 < α < 1, then convergence is finite-time.
