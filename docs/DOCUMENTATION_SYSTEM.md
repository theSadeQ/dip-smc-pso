make -f docs.mk dev

# Or step by step
make -f docs.mk install    # Install dependencies
make -f docs.mk build      # Build documentation
make -f docs.mk serve      # Serve locally at http://localhost:8000
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# Install enhanced dependencies
pip install -r dip_docs/docs/requirements-enhanced.txt

# Build with enhanced configuration
cd dip_docs/docs/source
cp conf_enhanced.py conf.py
sphinx-build -b html source _build/html

# Serve locally
python -m http.server 8000 -d _build/html
```

## 📊 Mathematical Features

### Equation Numbering and Cross-References
```rst
.. math::
   :label: eq:dip_dynamics

   M(q)\ddot{q} + C(q,\dot{q})\dot{q} + G(q) = Bu

As shown in {eq}`eq:dip_dynamics`, the DIP dynamics...
```

### Custom Mathematical Macros
- `\vec{x}` for vectors
- `\mat{A}` for matrices
- `\norm{x}` for norms
- `\state`, `\control`, `\error` for control theory
- And many more for consistent notation

### Professional Tables and Figures
```rst
.. _table:controller_parameters:

.. table:: Controller Parameters
   :name: table:controller_parameters

   +----------+--------------------+
   | Parameter| Description        |
   +==========+====================+
   | λ₁       | Cart sliding gain  |
   +----------+--------------------+
```

## 🎯 Citation System

### Bibliography Organization
- `refs_enhanced.bib` - Comprehensive bibliography with 40+ references
- Organized by topics: Control Theory, SMC, PSO, Software
- DOI links and complete metadata for all references

### In-Text Citations
```rst
The sliding mode control approach :cite:`Edwards1998` provides
robust performance for uncertain systems.
```

## 📈 Mermaid Diagrams

### System Architecture

2. **Citations**: Add to `refs_enhanced.bib` and cite with `:cite:`
3. **Figures**: Use Mermaid for diagrams, number with `:name:`
4. **Cross-references**: Use `:numref:` for automatic numbering

### Quality Assurance
- Automatic link checking
- Doctest validation for code examples
- RST syntax validation
- Performance monitoring

## 📚 Documentation Standards

### Mathematical Notation
- Consistent use of bold vectors: `\vec{x}`
- Matrix notation: `\mat{A}`
- Control theory symbols: `\state`, `\control`, `\error`
- Proper equation numbering and cross-referencing

### Writing Style
- Professional academic tone
- Clear section hierarchy with numbered headings
- Comprehensive cross-referencing between sections
- Complete citations for all theoretical concepts

### Technical Standards
- All code examples must be copy-pasteable
- All equations must be numbered and referenceable
- All figures and tables must have captions and numbers
- All external links must be validated

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build fails with import errors:**
```bash
pip install -r dip_docs/docs/requirements-enhanced.txt
```

**Mermaid diagrams not rendering:**
- Ensure `sphinxcontrib-mermaid` is installed
- Check diagram syntax in online Mermaid editor

**Citations not working:**
- Verify `.bib` files are in the correct location
- Check citation keys match exactly

**Math not rendering:**
- MathJax 3.0 is configured automatically
- Use `$$..$$` for display math, `$...$` for inline

### Performance Optimization
- Use `build-fast` for development (incremental builds)
- Monitor build performance with GitHub Actions analytics
- Optimize images and reduce file sizes for faster loading

## 📊 Performance Metrics

The documentation system is optimized for:
- **Fast builds**: Incremental building and parallel processing
- **Small output**: Optimized CSS/JS and compressed images
- **Fast loading**: CDN resources and efficient caching
