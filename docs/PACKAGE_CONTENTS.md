# Sphinx Documentation Implementation Package ## 📁 Package Contents for ChatGPT Review This package contains the complete implementation of production-grade Sphinx documentation with GitHub CI/CD based on expert recommendations. ### 🚀 Core Implementation Files #### GitHub Workflows (Enhanced CI/CD)

- `.github/workflows/docs-ci.yml` - PR documentation builds with performance monitoring
- `.github/workflows/docs-nightly.yml` - nightly validation with link checking
- `.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml` - Secure GitHub Pages deployment #### Sphinx Documentation Configuration
- `docs/conf.py` - Production Sphinx configuration with enhanced extensions
- `docs/requirements.txt` - Pinned dependencies with research-grade extensions
- `docs/refs.bib` - Academic bibliography with control theory references
- `docs/index.md` - MyST-formatted documentation homepage #### Quality Assurance & Testing
- `tests/test_linkcode.py` - permalink resolution testing
- `scripts/check_citations.py` - Citation health validation script
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hooks with documentation validation
- `.markdownlint.yaml` - MyST-compatible markdown linting configuration #### Configuration Files
- `.readthedocs.yaml` - Read the Docs configuration (alternative hosting)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md` - Detailed implementation summary
- `CHATGPT_EVALUATION_PROMPT.md` - Evaluation request and context ### 🎯 Key Features Implemented #### 1. Workflow Efficiency
- Path filters to prevent unnecessary builds
- Scoped permissions per job for security
- Concurrency controls with cancel-in-progress
- 7-minute PR build timeout with performance monitoring
- Doctrees caching for incremental builds #### 2. Enhanced Security
- Minimal permissions scoped per job (not globally)
- Separate permissions for build vs deploy jobs
- Actions pinned by major version
- Environment protection ready for github-pages #### 3. Robust Permalink Resolution
- Enhanced `linkcode_resolve` with edge case handling
- Support for decorated functions, properties, classmethods
- Windows path normalization to POSIX for URLs
- Module-level fallbacks when object source unavailable
- unit tests covering all scenarios #### 4. Performance Optimization
- Multi-layer caching: pip, doctrees, examples
- Build time budgets: 7min PR / 15min nightly
- Performance monitoring with page count tracking
- Conditional example execution based on build mode #### 5. Automated Quality Gates
- Citation health checking with duplicate/missing validation
- Link health monitoring with 99% pass rate threshold
- Permalink accuracy tests with URL format validation
- Build performance gates with timeout enforcement #### 6. Research-Grade Features
- Academic citation system with author-year formatting
- Mathematical notation support (dollarmath/amsmath)
- Theorem environments (sphinx-proof)
- Collapsible content (sphinx-togglebutton)
- Social media optimization (sphinxext.opengraph)
