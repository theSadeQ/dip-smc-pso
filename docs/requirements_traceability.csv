REQ‑001,The system shall settle to within 2 s for a 1 m step input.,KPI‑001,"UC‑Start‑01; UC‑Setpoint‑01",implemented,Measured using T‑001 step response.
REQ‑002,The system shall achieve less than 10 % overshoot for step changes in cart position.,KPI‑002,"UC‑Start‑01; UC‑Setpoint‑01",implemented,Evaluated in T‑001 via the overshoot of the cart response.
REQ‑003,The controller tuning process shall minimise a weighted cost combining integral squared error (ISE), control effort, control rate and sliding variable energy over the simulation horizon.,KPI‑003,UC‑Setpoint‑01,implemented,The PSO tuner minimises this multi‑objective cost; see `src/optimizer/pso_optimizer.py`.
REQ‑004,The closed‑loop system shall maintain phase margin ≥ 45° and gain margin ≥ 6 dB under ±10 % plant parameter variations.,KPI‑004,UC‑Setpoint‑01,implemented,Assessed via frequency‑response tests (T‑002).
REQ‑005,The fault detection module shall detect sensor dropouts longer than 100 ms (i.e. 10 consecutive samples at the 100 Hz update rate) and raise a fault flag; transitioning to a safe state is handled by higher‑level supervision.,Safety,UC‑Fault‑01,implemented (detection only),The FDI system returns a 'FAULT' status when the residual persists; it does not command a safe state.  External logic must set the force to zero and log the fault (T‑003).  Detection occurs after the residual exceeds the adaptive or fixed threshold for `persistence_counter` consecutive samples (10 by default).
