# Issue #12 - Completion Checklist Use this checklist to ensure all steps are completed before closing Issue #12. --- ## Phase 1: PSO Completion ✅ - [x] PSO started for 3 controllers
- [x] Classical SMC: 150/150 iterations
- [ ] Adaptive SMC: 150/150 iterations (currently 109/150)
- [ ] STA SMC: 150/150 iterations (currently 112/150)
- [ ] JSON results files generated **Status:** IN PROGRESS (~75% complete) --- ## Phase 2: Validation - [ ] Run validation script ```bash python scripts/optimization/validate_and_summarize.py ``` - [ ] Review validation JSON summary - Location: `docs/issue_12_validation_summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - [ ] Check validation results: - [ ] classical_smc: chattering < 2.0? - [ ] adaptive_smc: chattering < 2.0? - [ ] sta_smc: chattering < 2.0? - [ ] All: tracking < 0.1 rad? **Status:** PENDING PSO completion --- ## Phase 3: Decision Point ### If Validation PASSES (all chattering < 2.0): #### 3A.1: Update Config
- [ ] Preview config changes: ```bash python scripts/optimization/update_config_with_gains.py --dry-run ``` - [ ] Actually update config: ```bash python scripts/optimization/update_config_with_gains.py ``` - [ ] Backup created: `.archive/config_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.yaml` #### 3A.2: Test Controllers
- [ ] Test classical: `python simulate.py --ctrl classical_smc --plot`
- [ ] Test adaptive: `python simulate.py --ctrl adaptive_smc --plot`
- [ ] Test STA: `python simulate.py --ctrl sta_smc --plot` - [ ] Verify simulation stability (no divergence)
- [ ] Visual inspection of control smoothness
- [ ] Check console output for errors #### 3A.3: Update Documentation
- [ ] Fill in validation results in `docs/issue_12_final_resolution.md`
- [ ] Update "Optimized Gains" section with actual values
- [ ] Update "Validation Results" tables
- [ ] Fill in "Conclusion" section #### 3A.4: Final Commit
- [ ] Stage changes: ```bash git add config.yaml git add docs/issue_12_validation_summary_*.json git add docs/issue_12_final_resolution.md ``` - [ ] Create commit: ```bash git commit -m "RESOLVED: Issue #12 - Chattering reduction validated - Updated config.yaml with PSO-optimized gains - All controllers meet chattering target (<2.0) - Validation results: docs/issue_12_validation_summary_*.json - documentation in docs/issue_12_final_resolution.md Results: - classical_smc: chattering=X.XXX (target <2.0) [PASS] - adaptive_smc: chattering=X.XXX (target <2.0) [PASS] - sta_smc: chattering=X.XXX (target <2.0) [PASS] 🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>" ``` - [ ] Push to remote: ```bash git push origin main ``` #### 3A.5: Close Issue
- [ ] Navigate to: https://github.com/theSadeQ/dip-smc-pso/issues/12
- [ ] Add closing comment with summary
- [ ] Close issue --- ### If Validation FAILS (any chattering >= 2.0): #### 3B.1: Analyze Failure
- [ ] Review which controllers failed
- [ ] Check actual chattering values
- [ ] Confirm fitness function issue (tracking-focused, not chattering-focused) #### 3B.2: Re-optimize with Corrected Fitness
- [ ] Re-run classical (if failed): ```bash python scripts/optimization/optimize_chattering_focused.py --controller classical_smc --iters 150 ``` - [ ] Re-run adaptive (if failed): ```bash python scripts/optimization/optimize_chattering_focused.py --controller adaptive_smc --iters 150 ``` - [ ] Re-run STA (if failed): ```bash python scripts/optimization/optimize_chattering_focused.py --controller sta_smc --iters 150 ``` **Estimated Time:** ~3-4 hours per controller (can run in parallel) #### 3B.3: Wait for Completion
- [ ] Monitor progress: ```bash python scripts/optimization/watch_pso.py ``` - [ ] Wait until all complete #### 3B.4: Return to Phase 2
- [ ] Go back to "Phase 2: Validation"
- [ ] Repeat validation with new results --- ## Phase 4: Cleanup - [ ] Move `report.log` to `logs/` (if not already done)
- [ ] Check root directory count: `ls | wc -l` (target: ≤12)
- [ ] Remove any temporary test files
- [ ] Archive old PSO logs if needed --- ## Phase 5: Final Verification - [ ] All commits pushed to remote
- [ ] Issue #12 closed on GitHub
- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate
- [ ] Config.yaml has optimized gains
- [ ] All tests pass: `pytest tests/`
- [ ] Repository clean: `git status` --- ## Success Criteria Summary | Criterion | Target | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Chattering Reduction | < 2.0 | ⏳ Awaiting validation |
| Tracking Error | < 0.1 rad | ⏳ Awaiting validation |
| Control Effort | Reasonable | ⏳ Awaiting validation |
| Simulation Stability | No divergence | ⏳ Awaiting validation |
| Config Updated | Yes | ⏳ Pending validation pass |
| Documentation | Complete | ✅ Complete |
| All Tests Pass | Yes | ⏳ To be verified | --- ## Timeline Estimate **If validation PASSES:**
- Phase 2: 2-3 minutes (validation)
- Phase 3A: 10-15 minutes (config update, testing, documentation)
- Phase 4: 2-3 minutes (cleanup)
- Phase 5: 2-3 minutes (verification)
- **Total:** 15-25 minutes **If validation FAILS:**
- Phase 3B: 3-4 hours (re-optimization)
- Then add time for validation pass scenario
- **Total:** 3.5-4.5 hours --- ## Notes - **Likely Outcome:** Validation will fail (fitness function was tracking-focused)
- **Prepared Solution:** `optimize_chattering_focused.py` with corrected fitness ready
- **All Automation:** Scripts tested and ready for any outcome
- **Documentation:** guides available in `scripts/optimization/README.md` --- ## Quick Commands Reference ```bash
# Check PSO status
python scripts/optimization/check_pso_completion.py # Live dashboard
python scripts/optimization/watch_pso.py # Automated workflow (when complete)

``` --- **Last Updated:** 2025-09-30 18:56
**PSO Status:** 77.6% complete (classical done, adaptive/sta running)
**ETA:** ~19:25
