# Streamlit Dashboard Analysis

I'll perform comprehensive analysis of your Streamlit dashboard using Playwright MCP server for browser automation.

## Analysis Types

### 1. **Visual Quality Analysis**
- Screenshot all pages and states
- Verify plot rendering quality
- Check UI element alignment
- Detect visual regressions
- Capture error states

### 2. **Performance Analysis**
- Measure page load times
- Monitor simulation execution speed
- Analyze plot rendering performance
- Track memory usage
- Identify bottlenecks

### 3. **Functional Analysis**
- Test all interactive elements
- Verify form validation
- Check controller selection workflow
- Test PSO optimization flow
- Validate configuration loading

### 4. **Accessibility Analysis**
- Check keyboard navigation
- Verify screen reader compatibility
- Test color contrast
- Validate ARIA labels
- Check responsive design

## Quick Commands

### Screenshot Analysis
```
"Screenshot Streamlit dashboard homepage"
"Capture simulation results with classical SMC"
"Screenshot PSO convergence plot"
"Capture error state when invalid gains entered"
```

### Performance Testing
```
"Measure dashboard load time at localhost:8501"
"Profile classical SMC simulation execution"
"Monitor memory usage during 10 simulations"
"Benchmark plot rendering with 1000 data points"
```

### UI/UX Testing
```
"Test controller selection dropdown"
"Verify parameter validation workflow"
"Check PSO optimization button behavior"
"Test configuration file upload"
```

### Integration Testing
```
"Test complete classical SMC workflow end-to-end"
"Verify PSO optimization ‚Üí simulation workflow"
"Test controller comparison feature"
"Validate multi-step simulation workflow"
```

## Automated Analysis Workflow

I'll follow this systematic approach:

1. **Launch Dashboard** - Start Streamlit and verify accessibility
2. **Visual Inspection** - Screenshot all major pages/states
3. **Interaction Testing** - Test all buttons, forms, dropdowns
4. **Performance Measurement** - Collect timing and resource metrics
5. **Error Handling** - Test invalid inputs and edge cases
6. **Report Generation** - Create comprehensive analysis report

## Analysis Report Includes

- üìä Performance metrics (load time, simulation speed, memory)
- üñºÔ∏è Screenshot gallery of all tested states
- ‚úÖ Functional test results (pass/fail for each feature)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues found with severity ratings
- üìà Comparison with previous analysis (if available)
- üîß Recommendations for improvements

## Common Analysis Requests

**Full Dashboard Analysis:**
```
"Perform complete Streamlit dashboard analysis"
```

**Performance Focused:**
```
"Focus on performance analysis - measure load times and simulation speed"
```

**Visual Regression:**
```
"Compare current dashboard UI with screenshots from last week"
```

**Specific Feature:**
```
"Analyze PSO optimization feature - test workflow and measure performance"
```

**Pre-deployment Check:**
```
"Run pre-deployment validation on Streamlit dashboard"
```

## Prerequisites

Ensure Streamlit dashboard is running:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
# Dashboard at: http://localhost:8501
```

## What analysis would you like to perform?

Please specify:
- **Scope:** Full dashboard, specific feature, or workflow
- **Focus:** Visual, performance, functional, or comprehensive
- **Depth:** Quick smoke test, standard analysis, or deep dive
- **Comparison:** Standalone or vs previous version

Example request:
```
"Perform comprehensive dashboard analysis focusing on PSO optimization workflow,
including visual quality, performance metrics, and functional validation.
Compare with baseline screenshots from last session."
```
