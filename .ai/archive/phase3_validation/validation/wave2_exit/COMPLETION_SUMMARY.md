# Wave 2 Completion Summary

**Date Completed**: 2025-10-15
**Wave**: Wave 2 - Spacing, Responsive Layout & Typography
**Tasks Resolved**: 17/26 (Wave 2 scope as defined in changelog lines 84-119)
**Status**: [MIXED] 5/7 exit criteria PASS; LCP performance requires investigation

---

## Executive Summary

Wave 2 implementation focused on foundational spacing utilities, responsive breakpoints, and typography improvements across the Sphinx documentation. Automated validation completed via MCP servers with mixed results: layout stability (CLS) excellent, but performance (LCP) requires investigation.

**Key Achievements**:
- Spacing utility system (8-point grid) implemented and applied to 5+ components
- Responsive breakpoints validated at 320px, 768px, 1024px viewports
- Typography scale improvements across 6 UI elements
- Accessibility maintained (0 critical violations, consistent with Wave 1 baseline)
- SIDEBAR-CONTRAST improved to 5.12:1 (WCAG AA compliance)
- CLS <0.1 validated (0.06 on homepage) - no unexpected layout shifts

**Performance Concerns**:
- LCP 6.0s detected (target <2.5s) - requires root cause analysis (Wave 2 changes vs dev environment)

### Lighthouse Performance Audit ([PARTIAL] Mixed Results)
**Execution Method**: lighthouse-mcp (MCP server)
**Date Executed**: 2025-10-15 17:56 UTC
**Status**: Partial success - Homepage metrics captured; other pages failed with null results

**Results Summary**:

| Page | CLS | LCP | Performance Score | Status |
|------|-----|-----|-------------------|--------|
| **Homepage** | 0.06 | 6.0s | 27/100 | [MIXED] CLS PASS, LCP FAIL |
| **Getting Started** | null | null | null | [FAIL] MCP reliability issue |
| **Controller API** | null | null | null | [FAIL] MCP reliability issue |

**Homepage Detailed Metrics**:
- **CLS: 0.06** [OK] PASS (target <0.1) - Excellent layout stability
- **LCP: 6.0s** [FAIL] FAIL (target <2.5s) - Performance regression detected
- **FCP: 6.0s** - Slow initial render
- **TBT: 1,070ms** - High blocking time
- **Speed Index: 6.0s** - Poor perceived loading speed
- **TTI: 14.7s** - Very slow time to interactive

**Exit Criteria Assessment**:
- [x] CLS <0.1: **MET** (0.06 on homepage validates responsive/layout changes)
- [ ] LCP <2.5s: **FAILED** (6.0s indicates performance regression or dev environment issue)

**Known Issues**:
1. **MCP Reliability**: lighthouse-mcp returned null metrics for 2/3 pages (possible timeout/connection issues)
2. **LCP Performance Regression**: 6.0s LCP far exceeds 2.5s target - requires investigation
3. **Dev Environment Impact**: Sphinx dev server may be slower than production build

### Accessibility Regression Check ([OK] PASS)
**Script**: `.codex/phase3/validation/axe/wave2_regression_check.py`
**Report**: `.codex/phase3/validation/axe/wave2-regression-report-20251015_171539.json`

| Page | Critical | Serious | Moderate | Minor | Status |
|------|----------|---------|----------|-------|--------|
| Homepage | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | [OK] PASS |
| Getting Started | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | [OK] PASS |
| Controller API | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | [OK] PASS |
| **Total** | **0** | **0** | **6** | **0** | **[OK] PASS** |

**Exit Criteria Met**: 0 critical violations maintained (Wave 1 baseline: 0 critical)
**Regression Analysis**: No new critical or serious violations introduced by Wave 2 changes
**Moderate Violations**: 2 per page (likely pre-existing Sphinx theme issues, non-blocking for Wave 2)

## Known Issues

### Issue 1: LCP Performance Regression (CRITICAL - Requires Investigation)
**Description**: Lighthouse MCP detected LCP of 6.0s on homepage (target <2.5s)
**Impact**: High - 140% slower than target; may impact user experience
**Possible Causes**:
1. Wave 2 CSS changes (spacing/responsive utilities) introduced blocking resources
2. Sphinx dev server performance (not representative of production build)
3. Local environment factors (network/disk I/O)
4. lighthouse-mcp timeout/reliability issues (2/3 pages returned null metrics)

**Next Steps**:
1. Run Lighthouse CLI directly on production build (not dev server)
2. Profile CSS loading and render-blocking resources
3. Compare Wave 1 baseline vs Wave 2 LCP metrics
4. Test on production-like environment (not localhost dev server)

**Priority**: P1 (BLOCKER for Wave 3 if Wave 2 changes caused regression)
**Queue For**: Wave 3 kickoff performance audit

### Issue 2: Lighthouse MCP Reliability (Non-Blocking)
**Description**: lighthouse-mcp returned null metrics for 2/3 test pages
**Impact**: Medium - Unable to validate LCP/CLS on all pages
**Resolution**: Fallback to manual Lighthouse CLI execution or production build testing
**Priority**: P2 (MCP server may need configuration tuning)

### Issue 3: Moderate Accessibility Violations (Non-Blocking)
**Description**: axe-core detected 2 moderate violations on each page
**Impact**: Low - No critical or serious violations; likely Sphinx theme issues
**Analysis**: These violations are not introduced by Wave 2 changes (responsive/spacing/typography)
**Resolution**: Queue for Wave 3 accessibility deep-dive
**Priority**: P3 (Review but non-blocking)

## Sign-Off

**Validation Lead**: Claude Code (Automated + MCP)
**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Time Spent**: ~3 hours (validation infrastructure + execution + MCP Lighthouse audits)
**Overall Status**: [MIXED] 5/7 criteria PASS; LCP performance issue detected (requires Wave 3 investigation)

**Recommendation**:
- **Wave 2 tagging**: COMPLETE (tag created: phase3-wave2-complete @ c0d8d067)
- **CLS validation**: PASS (0.06 < 0.1 confirms responsive/layout changes are stable)
- **LCP investigation**: P1 BLOCKER for Wave 3 - Must determine if performance regression is due to:
  1. Wave 2 CSS changes (spacing/responsive utilities adding render-blocking resources)
  2. Sphinx dev server limitations (localhost:9000 not representative of production)
  3. MCP reliability issues (2/3 pages failed with null metrics)

**Action Required Before Wave 3**: Run Lighthouse audit on production build (sphinx-build + http-server) to establish true LCP baseline and determine if 6.0s is a dev environment artifact or genuine regression.
