## Valid Claims Requiring Citations

### 1. CODE-IMPL-084: Central Limit Theorem

**Description:** "the trial execution logic for running multiple independent simulations (attributed to: control systems)"

**File:** `src\benchmarks\core\trial_runner.py:1`

**Full Context:**
```python
\"\"\"
This module implements the trial execution logic for running multiple
independent simulations of control systems. It handles:
- Batch simulation execution
- Randomization and seeding

The Central Limit Theorem implies that for skewed distributions, a sample
size of at least 25–30 trials is required for the sample mean to approximate
a normal distribution. By default, 30 trials are executed.
\"\"\"
```

**Citation Needed:**
- **Topic:** Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
- **Specific claim:** Sample size requirement (25-30 trials for skewed distributions)
- **Expected citation:** Statistical theory textbook (e.g., Hogg & Tanis, Montgomery & Runger)
- **BibTeX key suggestion:** `hogg2009probability` or similar

**Research Notes:**
- This is a well-established statistical principle
- Citation should reference CLT and sample size requirements
- May cite experimental design textbooks for the 30-trial rule of thumb

### 2. CODE-IMPL-089: Classical Control Metrics

**Description:** "classical control theory and provide quantitative measures (attributed to: system performance)"

**File:** `src\benchmarks\metrics\control_metrics.py:1`

**Full Context:**
```python
\"\"\"
Control performance metrics for dynamic systems.

This module computes fundamental control engineering metrics that measure
the quality of tracking performance and control effort. These metrics are
derived from classical control theory and provide quantitative measures
of system performance.

Metrics implemented:
* **ISE (Integral of Squared Error)**: Measures cumulative tracking error
* **ITAE (Integral of Time-weighted Absolute Error)**: Emphasizes late-time errors
* **RMS Control Effort**: Measures actuator usage and energy consumption
\"\"\"
```

**Citation Needed:**
- **Topic:** Classical control performance metrics
- **Specific metrics:** ISE, ITAE, RMS control effort
- **Expected citations:**
  - Franklin, Powell & Emami-Naeini "Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems"
  - Ogata "Modern Control Engineering"
  - Dorf & Bishop "Modern Control Systems"
- **BibTeX key suggestions:** `franklin2014feedback`, `ogata2009modern`, `dorf2010modern`

**Research Notes:**
- These are standard metrics taught in undergraduate control courses
- Citation should reference classical control textbooks
- ISE and ITAE are classic integral performance indices

## Skipped Claims (5 total)

### Malformed (4 claims)
- CODE-IMPL-001: "None (attributed to: None)"
- CODE-IMPL-096: "None (attributed to: None)"
- CODE-IMPL-250: "None (attributed to: None)"
- CODE-IMPL-320: "None (attributed to: None)"

### Implementation Detail (1 claim)
- CODE-IMPL-088: "metrics that quantify constraint violations"
  - **Reason:** Implementation of constraint checking, not constraint theory
  - **File:** `constraint_metrics.py` - counts violations, doesn't cite theory

## Research Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare ChatGPT Prompt

Use the enhanced prompt template from `PROMPT_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md` with these 2 claims.

### Step 2: Expected Citations

**For CODE-IMPL-084 (CLT):**
```
CLAIM 1 (ID: CODE-IMPL-084):
- Citation: Hogg & Tanis (2009)
- BibTeX Key: hogg2009probability
- DOI: N/A (textbook)
- Type: book
- Note: Chapter on Central Limit Theorem, discusses sample size requirements
  for approximating normal distribution from skewed populations (Rule of 30).
```

**For CODE-IMPL-089 (Control Metrics):**
```
CLAIM 2 (ID: CODE-IMPL-089):
- Citation: Franklin, Powell & Emami-Naeini (2014)
- BibTeX Key: franklin2014feedback
- DOI: N/A (textbook)
- Type: book
- Note: Chapter 3 discusses ISE, ITAE, and other integral performance indices
  as classical measures of control system performance.
```

### Step 3: Fill CSV

For each citation:
1. Find claim in CSV by ID
2. Fill 6 tracking columns:
   - Research_Status: `completed`
   - Suggested_Citation: [from ChatGPT]
   - BibTeX_Key: [from ChatGPT]
   - DOI_or_URL: [from ChatGPT]
   - Reference_Type: [from ChatGPT]
   - Research_Notes: [from ChatGPT]

### Step 4: Verify

- Total time: ~24 minutes (2 claims)
- Batch 17 completion: 2/7 claims cited (29% valid rate)
- Save CSV and run progress tracker

## Success Criteria

✅ **This batch is COMPLETE when:**
- [ ] 2 valid claims have citations in CSV
- [ ] ChatGPT response backed up
- [ ] Progress tracker confirms 2 claims completed
- [ ] CSV saved successfully

**Estimated Time:** 24 minutes (vs original 1.4 hours)
**Time Saved:** 1.15 hours (60 minutes skipped)
**Efficiency Gain:** 71% reduction

---

## Quality Notes

**Why this batch has higher valid rate (29% vs 7% overall):**

1. **Topic:** "control_theory_general" focuses on theory, not implementation
2. **Files:** Include theoretical references (CLT, classical metrics)
3. **Content:** Docstrings reference established concepts, not code patterns

**Lesson:** Batches with "theory" in topic name have higher quality than "implementation" topics.
