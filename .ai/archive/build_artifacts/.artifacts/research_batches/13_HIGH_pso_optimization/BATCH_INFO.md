## Likely Citations (Pre-Research Suggestions)

Based on the topic **Pso Optimization**, you will likely find references to:

- Kennedy & Eberhart (1995) 'Particle swarm optimization'
- Shi & Eberhart (1998) 'A modified particle swarm optimizer'
- Clerc & Kennedy (2002) 'The particle swarm - explosion, stability, and convergence'


**Research Strategy:**
1. Start with these classic references
2. Check if they cover the specific techniques in your claims
3. If not, search for more specific papers (ChatGPT will help!)
