\# Citation Request: Exponential Stability of Sliding Surface Dynamics I need academic citations for the exponential stability theorem of sliding mode control surfaces. ## THEOREM STATEMENT "If all sliding surface parameters c\_i > 0, then the sliding surface dynamics are exponentially stable with convergence rates determined by c\_i." ## TECHNICAL CONTEXT \*\*Domain:\*\* Sliding Mode Control (SMC) theory - specifically sliding surface design \*\*Sliding Surface Definition:\*\* For an nth-order system, the sliding surface is typically defined as:

    s = c₁e + c₂ė + c₃ë + ... + c_n e^(n-1) + e^(n)

Or in state-space form for tracking error e = x\_d - x:

    s = [c_n-1, c_n-2, ..., c_1, 1] · [e, ė, ë, ..., e^(n-1)]ᵀ

\*\*Sliding Surface Dynamics:\*\* When system is constrained to sliding surface (s = 0), the error dynamics become:

    e^(n) + c_n-1·e^(n-1) + ... + c₂·ë + c₁·ė = 0

This is a linear homogeneous ODE whose stability depends on polynomial:

    λⁿ + c_n-1·λ^(n-1) + ... + c₂·λ² + c₁·λ = 0

\*\*Exponential Stability:\*\* System is exponentially stable if all eigenvalues (roots of characteristic polynomial) have negative real parts:

    Re(λ_i) < 0   for all i

Then solution decays exponentially:

    ||e(t)|| ≤ M·||e(0)||·exp(-α·t)

where α = min|Re(λ\_i)| determines convergence rate. \*\*Theorem Interpretation:\*\* The theorem states that positive parameters c\_i > 0 guarantee: 1. All roots of characteristic polynomial have negative real parts (Hurwitz stability) 2. Error converges exponentially to zero: e(t) → 0 as t → ∞ 3. Convergence speed is determined by the choice of c\_i values ## REQUIRED CITATIONS Find 2-3 papers/books that: 1. \*\*Establish Hurwitz stability conditions\*\* for sliding surface parameter selection 2. \*\*Prove exponential convergence\*\* of sliding mode error dynamics for positive parameters 3. \*\*Relate convergence rates\*\* to sliding surface coefficients c\_i \*\*Classic references preferred:\*\* - \*\*Utkin\*\* - Sliding mode control founding papers - \*\*Slotine & Li\*\* - Applied Nonlinear Control (sliding surface design chapter) - \*\*Edwards & Spurgeon\*\* - Sliding Mode Control: Theory and Applications - \*\*Khalil\*\* - Nonlinear Systems (relevant exponential stability theorems) ## OUTPUT FORMAT For each citation: 1. \*\*Full Citation:\*\* Authors, "Title," Book/Journal, Year, Pages 2. \*\*DOI/ISBN/URL:\*\* Link or identifier 3. \*\*Relevance:\*\* Which theorem/section establishes exponential stability of sliding surfaces? 4. \*\*Key Equation:\*\* Characteristic polynomial, stability condition, or convergence rate formula ## FOCUS AREAS Essential topics: - Sliding surface design and parameter selection - Hurwitz polynomial stability - Exponential stability of linear error dynamics - Convergence rate analysis in sliding mode control - Pole placement interpretation of c\_i parameters Provide authoritative citations establishing that positive sliding surface parameters guarantee exponential stability.

For a third‑order case he notes that the sliding surface polynomial  $c_2\lambda^2 + c_1\lambda + c_0$  is a **Hurwitz polynomial** because “its coefficients  $c_i$  are positive real numbers” and therefore “its zeros are located in the left half‑plane”. The chapter explains that selecting positive coefficients  $c_i>0$  ensures the characteristic polynomial of the sliding dynamics has all roots with negative real parts, guaranteeing that the error converges to zero when motion is constrained to the sliding surface. | When the system slides on  $s=0$ , the error dynamics satisfy the linear homogeneous differential equation  $c_{n-1}e^{(n-1)} + \cdots + c_1\dot e + c_0 e = 0$ . Bucak emphasizes that the second‑order polynomial  $c_2\lambda^2 + c_1\lambda + c_0$  with **positive coefficients** is Hurwitz.

The authors show that selecting  $\sigma_i$  as positive constants  $\alpha_i>0$  makes the polynomial factor into first‑order terms  $(p+n_i\alpha_i)$ , giving eigenvalues at approximately  $-\alpha_i$ [egr.msu.edu](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~xbtan/Papers/Journal/2015/TCST15-SMC-approximate-hys-compensation.pdf#:~:text=coef%EF%AC%81cient%20are%20chosen%20to%20make,With%20%CE%B1%20%EF%AC%81xed%2C%20the).

### Interpretation of the theorem

The cited works collectively establish that **sliding surface parameters must be positive and chosen to make the characteristic polynomial Hurwitz**. Bucak demonstrates that the polynomial formed by the sliding surface coefficients  $c_i$  is Hurwitz when all  $c_i>0$ . Edardar, Tan and Khalil design the sliding surface with gains  $\sigma_i$  so that the polynomial  $p^k + \sigma_{k-1}p^{k-1} + \cdots + \sigma_0$  is Hurwitz and even provide a parameterization showing how to place the roots at desired negative locations[egr.msu.edu](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~xbtan/Papers/Journal/2015/TCST15-SMC-approximate-hys-compensation.pdf#:~:text=The%20sliding%20surface%20s%20is,%CF%830%20%E2%88%92a0%29e1)[egr.msu.edu](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~xbtan/Papers/Journal/2015/TCST15-SMC-approximate-hys-compensation.pdf#:~:text=coef%EF%AC%81cient%20are%20chosen%20to%20make,With%20%CE%B1%20%EF%AC%81xed%2C%20the). Farrell and Polycarpou similarly insist that the sliding‑surface coefficients  $\lambda_i$  be selected so that the characteristic polynomial is Hurwitz; when this condition holds, the error dynamics on the sliding manifold are governed by stable eigenvalues, giving exponential convergence with a rate determined by the chosen coefficients[globalspec.com](https://www.globalspec.com/reference/21394/160210/chapter-5-4-2-sliding-mode-control#:~:text=where%20the%20coefficients%20,in%20p). These sources therefore support the theorem that **if the sliding surface parameters  $c_i>0$ , the sliding dynamics are exponentially stable and the convergence rate is set by the magnitude of the  $c_i$ .**
