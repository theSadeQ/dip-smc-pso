# Academic citations supporting the hysteresis theorem for Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI)

Theorem: **"Hysteresis with deadband δ prevents oscillation for residuals with bounded derivative."**
Residual‑based FDI schemes compare the residual signal with thresholds to decide whether a fault is present. When residuals hover near the threshold, measurement noise can cause the detection logic to switch rapidly between fault/no‑fault states (chattering). Hysteresis introduces two thresholds separated by a *deadband* δ, meaning that once the alarm is triggered, the residual must cross a lower threshold before the alarm is cleared. When the residual derivative is bounded, this deadband guarantees that the residual cannot cross back and forth quickly, preventing oscillation.

Miljkovic notes that adding *hysteresis* – two thresholds separated by a deadband H – eliminates this instability: once the alarm is triggered at the upper threshold TH, the input "must undergo a significant reversal" before the residual falls below the lower threshold TL and the alarm can be cleared. A pseudocode implementation shows that residuals are compared against TH to trigger the alarm and against TL to reset it. These descriptions justify that hysteresis prevents chattering caused by noise in residual signals. |

In Section 3 the authors add hysteresis to the switching logic and state that the existence of solutions is guaranteed when the input and reference signals are bounded and have **bounded derivative**. They specify switching conditions with upper and lower thresholds (RH and HH) and note that with hysteresis the integrator remains in one state until the error signal crosses the opposite threshold. They show that if the hysteresis level is positive (even arbitrarily small) and the error signal has bounded derivative, switching cannot occur infinitely often, hence oscillations in the switching logic are avoided. |

In Section 4 they show that the set of switch instants has **bounded cardinality**. They prove that the hysteresis‑based switching control system is stable despite possibly unbounded noise. The result implies that hysteresis ensures a **finite number of switches** (no chattering), which is directly analogous to limiting oscillations in threshold‑based fault detection. |

## How these citations support the theorem

- **Eliminating chattering using two thresholds:** Miljkovic's review explains that when residuals are compared to a single threshold, noise can cause rapid oscillations between fault and no‑fault states. By introducing two thresholds TH and TL (deadband δ), the decision logic latches the fault state until the residual falls below TL. The residual must undergo a "significant reversal" before a state change, effectively introducing hysteresis. This description provides the fundamental concept behind the theorem.

- **Bound on switching when residual derivative is limited:** Lau and Middleton analyse switched integrator control and prove that when hysteresis is added to the switch and the error signal has a bounded rate of change (bounded derivative), the switching logic has solutions and does not exhibit infinite switching. The bounded derivative ensures the residual cannot cross both thresholds arbitrarily quickly; a sufficient deadband δ ensures enough time between crossings to avoid chattering.

- **Finite number of switches and robustness to noise:** Prandini et al. extend hysteresis‑based switching to stochastic systems and show that the **number of switching times is bounded**. Even with unbounded noise, the hysteresis factor prevents frequent switching, and the system remains stable. Their result demonstrates that hysteresis provides robust switching logic that does not oscillate, which aligns with the theorem's claim that hysteresis prevents oscillation for bounded‑rate residuals.

Together, these works provide mathematical and practical support for the theorem. Hysteresis thresholds introduce a deadband that must be traversed before changing states, ensuring that noisy residual signals with bounded derivative cannot cause rapid oscillations. The citations show that hysteresis is widely used in FDI limit checking, that bounded derivative conditions guarantee the absence of infinite switching, and that the number of switchings is finite under hysteresis control.
