### Role of stability conditions and inertia weight

Before establishing almost‑sure convergence, most analyses identify _stability_ conditions for the PSO parameters. A 2011 arXiv paper on stochastic PSO shows that the inertia weight  $\omega$  and acceleration coefficients  $\varphi_1,\varphi_2$  must satisfy specific inequalities to ensure velocities remain bounded. In particular, the authors note that for mean‑square convergence one needs a sufficiently small inertia weight ( $|\omega|<1$ ) and the sum of the acceleration coefficients less than four times  $1+\omega$ [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.5540#:~:text=to%20see%20%28e.%20g.%2C%20,to%20take%20the%20stochastic%20e%EF%AC%80ects). An even stricter inequality is given for asymptotic (Lyapunov) stability[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.5540#:~:text=to%20see%20%28e.%20g.%2C%20,to%20take%20the%20stochastic%20e%EF%AC%80ects). These conditions are often met in practice by **decreasing the inertia weight over time**, which gradually reduces velocity and moves the swarm into the stability region.

Summary of theorem context

Under the **stability conditions** provided by Trelea & Kadirkamanathan (bounded inertia weight and suitable acceleration coefficients) and using a **decreasing inertia weight**, the swarm’s velocities decay and the system enters the convergent region. For **unimodal functions**, Schmitt’s analysis shows that classical PSO then converges to the unique optimum almost surely. Nigatu et al. extend this reasoning by modelling PSO variants with a **linearly decreasing inertia weight** and proving that the algorithm converges to an optimal solution **with probability 1** and will find the **global optimum** given enough time[frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fams.2024.1304268/pdf#:~:text=,%EF%AC%81nd%20the%20globally%20optimal%20solution).

These sources together justify the probabilistic global convergence theorem stated in the question: _“Under the stability condition and with decreasing inertia weight, PSO converges to the global optimum with probability 1 for unimodal functions.”_
