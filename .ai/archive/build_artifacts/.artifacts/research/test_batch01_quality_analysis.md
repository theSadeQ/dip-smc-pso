## Detailed Analysis by Claim

### Claim 1: FORMAL-THEOREM-016
**Statement:** "If all sliding surface parameters $c_i > 0$, then the sliding surface dynamics are exponentially stable with convergence rates determined by $c_i$."

**Query Generated:**
```
"all sliding surface parameters $c_i 0$, then sliding surface dynamics are exponentially stable convergence rates determined $c_i$."
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ Malformed query (missing ">", LaTeX not cleaned)
- ❌ Only 1 query (should be 3-5)
- ❌ Still contains LaTeX: `$c_i`

**Citations Selected:**

| # | Title | Relevance | Citation Count | Issue |
|---|-------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| 1 | The Volume of a Surface or Orbifold Pair | ❌ IRRELEVANT | 0 | Pure algebraic geometry, not control theory |
| 2 | Stability of an inviscid flow through a tube | ❌ IRRELEVANT | 0 | Fluid dynamics, not SMC |
| 3 | Design of Sliding Mode PID Controller | ✅ RELEVANT | 0 | SMC, reaching laws, convergence |

**Relevance Score: 33% (1/3)**

**Root Cause:** Ranking algorithm selected papers with "sliding surface" and "stability" keywords from *any* domain (math, fluids) without filtering for control theory context.

---

### Claim 2: FORMAL-THEOREM-019
**Statement:** "Under the reaching condition {eq}`eq:reaching_condition`, the system reaches the sliding surface in finite time bounded by:"

**Query Generated:**
```
"Under reaching condition {eq}`eq:reaching_condition`, system reaches sliding surface finite time bounded by:"
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ Contains equation reference: `{eq}`eq:reaching_condition``
- ❌ Only 1 query (should be 3-5)

**Citations Selected:**

| # | Title | Relevance | Citation Count | Quality |
|---|-------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | Finite-Time Reaching Law Based SMC of Quantum Systems | ✅ RELEVANT | 0 | Finite-time reaching, SMC |
| 2 | Discrete-Time Adaptive Controller... Reaching Sliding Condition | ✅ RELEVANT | 0 | Reaching condition, sliding |
| 3 | Reduction of the reaching mode by SMC | ✅ RELEVANT | 0 | Reaching mode, SMC |

**Relevance Score: 100% (3/3)** ✅

**Success Factor:** Query extracted core concepts ("reaching condition", "finite time", "sliding surface") correctly despite LaTeX reference.

---

### Claim 3: FORMAL-THEOREM-020
**Statement:** "The classical SMC law {eq}`eq:classical_smc_structure` with switching gain $\eta > \rho$ ensures global finite-time convergence."

**Query Generated:**
```
"classical sliding mode control sliding surface"
```

**Issues:**
- ✅ Clean query (LaTeX removed)
- ❌ Only 1 query (should be 3-5)
- ⚠️ Lost specificity (no mention of "switching gain", "finite-time convergence")

**Citations Selected:**

| # | Title | Relevance | Citation Count | Quality |
|---|-------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | Sliding Mode Control for the Satellite... | ✅ RELEVANT | 7 | Classical SMC, convergence |
| 2 | Robust Control for Five-level Inverter... Integral SMC | ✅ RELEVANT | 5 | Integral SMC, robustness |
| 3 | Data-Driven SMC for Partially Unknown Nonlinear Systems | ✅ RELEVANT | 2 | SMC, nonlinear systems |

**Relevance Score: 100% (3/3)** ✅

**Success Factor:** Query correctly identified "classical sliding mode control" as primary concept.

---

### Claim 4: FORMAL-THEOREM-023
**Statement:** "With the boundary layer method, the tracking error is ultimately bounded by:"

**Query Generated:**
```
"tracking boundary layer"
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ Too generic - matches *fluid dynamics* boundary layers instead of *SMC boundary layer method*
- ❌ Only 1 query (should be 3-5)
- ❌ Missing SMC context

**Citations Selected:**

| # | Title | Relevance | Citation Count | Issue |
|---|-------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| 1 | Particle–fluid–wall interaction in turbulent boundary layer | ❌ IRRELEVANT | 41 | Fluid dynamics, not SMC |
| 2 | Combined flow field measurements... turbulent boundary layer | ❌ IRRELEVANT | 16 | Fluid dynamics, not SMC |
| 3 | Linear wavepacket tracking for hypersonic boundary-layer | ❌ IRRELEVANT | 41 | Fluid dynamics, not SMC |

**Relevance Score: 0% (0/3)** ❌

**Root Cause:**
1. Query didn't include "sliding mode" context
2. Ranking heavily weighted citation count (41, 16, 41 citations)
3. No domain filtering (fluid dynamics vs control theory)

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Query Generator Issues

**Problem:** Only 1 query generated per claim (should be 3-5)

**Evidence:**
```python
# From logs
[DEBUG] Generated 1 queries for FORMAL-THEOREM-016
[DEBUG] Generated 1 queries for FORMAL-THEOREM-019
[DEBUG] Generated 1 queries for FORMAL-THEOREM-020
[DEBUG] Generated 1 queries for FORMAL-THEOREM-023
```

**Hypothesis:**
- Claims lack author names → No Priority 1 queries (algorithm + author)
- Claims have weak mathematical term extraction → Fewer Priority 2 queries
- Missing topic extraction → No Priority 3 queries
- Falls back to single cleaned claim text

**Fix Required:** Enhance query diversity for formal theorem claims without citations.

---

### 2. LaTeX Cleanup Missing

**Problem:** Queries contain raw LaTeX symbols and equation references

**Evidence:**
- Claim 1: `"...parameters $c_i 0$..."`
- Claim 2: `"...{eq}`eq:reaching_condition`..."`

**Hypothesis:** `_clean_text()` doesn't handle:
- LaTeX math mode (`$...$`)
- MyST Markdown equation references (`{eq}`...``)
- Comparison operators (`>`, `<`) inside math mode

**Fix Required:** Add LaTeX and MyST cleanup to `QueryGenerator._clean_text()`.

---

### 3. Ranking Algorithm Prioritizes Citation Count

**Problem:** High-citation papers from wrong domains rank higher than low-citation relevant papers

**Evidence:** Claim 4 selected three 41-citation, 16-citation, 41-citation *fluid dynamics* papers over *SMC* papers.

**Current Scoring:**
```python
score += math.log(paper.citation_count + 1) * 2.0  # Heavy weight on citations
score += overlap * 0.5  # Light weight on title relevance
```

**Fix Required:**
- Reduce citation count weight
- Increase title/abstract relevance weight
- Add domain filtering (control theory vs fluid dynamics)
- Implement semantic similarity matching

---

### 4. Topic Inference Failed

**Problem:** "boundary layer method" not recognized as SMC-specific term

**Evidence:** Query for Claim 4 was `"tracking boundary layer"` without "sliding mode" context.

**Expected Behavior:** Query should be `"sliding mode boundary layer tracking error"`.

**Fix Required:** Add SMC-specific terms to `QueryGenerator.MATHEMATICAL_TERMS`:
```python
"boundary layer method",
"boundary layer thickness",
"chattering reduction",
```

---

## Recommended Fixes (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: Fix Query Generation (Critical)

**File:** `.dev_tools/research/query_generator.py`

1. **Add LaTeX cleanup:**
```python
def _clean_text(self, text: str) -> str:
    # Remove LaTeX math mode
    text = re.sub(r'\$[^$]+\$', '', text)

    # Remove MyST equation references
    text = re.sub(r'\{eq\}`[^`]+`', '', text)

    # Remove comparison operators outside context
    text = re.sub(r'\s+[<>]=?\s+', ' ', text)

    # ... existing cleanup ...
```

2. **Enhance query diversity for formal theorems:**
```python
# If no authors, generate mathematical concept queries
if not authors and math_terms:
    for i in range(min(3, len(math_terms))):
        # Combine algorithm + math term
        queries.append(Query(
            text=f"{algorithms[0]} {math_terms[i]}",
            priority=2,
            keywords=[algorithms[0], math_terms[i]],
            query_type="concept"
        ))
```

3. **Add SMC-specific term mapping:**
```python
CONTROL_TOPICS = {
    "boundary layer method": "sliding mode boundary layer",
    "chattering reduction": "sliding mode chattering",
    # ... existing topics ...
}
```

---

### Priority 2: Improve Ranking Algorithm (Critical)

**File:** `.dev_tools/research/research_pipeline.py`

1. **Reduce citation weight, increase relevance weight:**
```python
def _rank_papers(self, papers: List[Paper], claim_text: str) -> List[Paper]:
    # Citation count (reduced weight)
    score += math.log(paper.citation_count + 1) * 0.5  # Was 2.0

    # Title relevance (increased weight)
    overlap = len(claim_keywords & title_keywords)
    score += overlap * 2.0  # Was 0.5
```

2. **Add domain filtering:**
```python
def _is_control_theory_paper(self, paper: Paper) -> bool:
    """Check if paper is control theory vs other domains."""
    control_keywords = {
        'control', 'controller', 'sliding mode', 'lyapunov',
        'stability', 'feedback', 'regulation', 'tracking'
    }

    # Check title and abstract
    text = (paper.title + ' ' + (paper.abstract or '')).lower()

    # Penalize if fluid dynamics
    fluid_keywords = {'turbulent', 'reynolds number', 'flow', 'fluid'}
    if any(kw in text for kw in fluid_keywords):
        return False

    # Require at least one control keyword
    return any(kw in text for kw in control_keywords)
```

3. **Apply domain filter in ranking:**
```python
# Penalize non-control-theory papers
if not self._is_control_theory_paper(paper):
    score -= 10.0  # Heavy penalty
```

---

### Priority 3: Improve BibTeX Quality (Medium)

**File:** `.dev_tools/research/bibtex_generator.py`

1. **Fix venue classification:**
```python
def _determine_entry_type(self, paper: Paper) -> str:
    # Check for journal patterns first (more reliable)
    journal_keywords = ['journal', 'transactions', 'letters', 'magazine', 'review']

    # "International Journal..." should be @article, not @inproceedings
    if any(kw in venue_lower for kw in journal_keywords):
        return "article"
```

2. **Resolve "Unknown" journals:**
```python
# Map common venues
VENUE_MAPPINGS = {
    'arxiv': 'arXiv',
    'semantic scholar': 'Semantic Scholar',
    # Add common journals
}
```

---

### Priority 4: Increase DOI Coverage (Low)

**Options:**
1. Prioritize papers with DOIs in ranking
2. Add DOI lookup from CrossRef API
3. Use alternative identifiers (arXiv IDs)
