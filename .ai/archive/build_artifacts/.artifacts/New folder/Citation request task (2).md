Finite‑Time Reaching Condition in Sliding‑Mode Control
======================================================

Sliding‑mode control (SMC) consists of two phases: a **reaching (hitting) phase** in which the state trajectory is steered from its initial conditions to a lower‑dimensional _sliding surface_, and a **sliding phase** in which motion stays on that surface. The reaching law must guarantee that the sliding variable  $s$  goes to zero in finite time despite uncertainties. In practice this is achieved by designing a discontinuous control law such that the product of  $s$  and its derivative  $\dot{s}$  is strictly negative— $\dot V=s\dot s \le -\eta|s|$  when  $V= \tfrac12 s^2$  is a Lyapunov function—leading to finite‑time convergence. Below are authoritative references that derive this finite‑time reaching condition and give explicit bounds on the reaching time.

### Summary

Khalil’s notes use the **Lyapunov reaching law**  $\dot s = -\eta\,\operatorname{sgn}(s)$ , where  $\eta=g_0\beta_0>0$ . This yields  $\dot V = s\dot s \le -\eta|s|$  and thus  $|s(t)| \le |s(0)| - \eta t$ . Setting  $s(T_{\rm reach})=0$  gives the **explicit time bound**

$$
T_{\rm reach} = \frac{|s(0)|}{\eta} \,.

### Summary

Kunusch et al. develop a **Lyapunov‑based finite‑time stability proposition**: when  $\dot V \le -\alpha\sqrt{V}$  the system reaches the equilibrium in finite time  $T \le 2\sqrt{V_0}/\alpha$ [control.dii.unisi.it](https://control.dii.unisi.it/anc/pdf/Sliding_mode.pdf#:~:text=%283,9). Applying this to  $V=\tfrac12 s^2$  with  $\dot s = -\eta\,\mathrm{sgn}(s)$  yields  $\alpha = \sqrt{2}\,\eta$  and the bound  $T_{\rm reach} \le |s(0)|/\eta$ . The chapter emphasises that the reaching condition  $\dot{s}s < \kappa |s|$  ensures finite‑time convergence and that the reaching time can be computed from the initial value and the reaching‑law gain.

They derive the explicit formula for the hitting time: if  $s(0)>0$ , then  $s(t)=s(0)-k t$  and the **reaching time** is  $T_{\rm reach}=s(0)/k$ [kybernetika.cz](https://www.kybernetika.cz/content/2001/3/277/paper.pdf#:~:text=obtaining%20finite,can%20also%20be%20worked%20out).

### Summary

Slávik & Dostál’s example uses the **constant‑rate reaching law**  $\dot{s}=-k\,\mathrm{sgn}(s)$ .

They note that the system reaches the sliding surface in a finite time and remains on it subsequently, reaffirming the finite‑time reaching theorem.

Discussion and importance
-------------------------

These references provide rigorous proofs of the **finite‑time reaching theorem** in sliding‑mode control:

1.  **Reaching condition:** The derivative of the Lyapunov function  $V$  must satisfy a strict negative bound, typically  $\dot V \le -\eta|s|$ . This implies  $\dot{s}\,s \le -\eta|s|$ . The inequality ensures that  $V$  decreases sufficiently fast and prevents the state from oscillating indefinitely.
    
2.  **Finite‑time convergence:** Integrating the inequality gives  $|s(t)| \le |s(0)| - \eta t$ . Therefore the sliding variable reaches zero in at most  $T_{\rm reach}=|s(0)|/\eta$  seconds[egr.msu.edu](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~khalil/NonlinearSystems/Sample/Lect_32.pdf#:~:text=%E2%89%A4%E2%88%92g0%CE%B20%20%E2%88%9A%202%20t%20p,reaches%20zero%20in%20%EF%AC%81nite%20time)[kybernetika.cz](https://www.kybernetika.cz/content/2001/3/277/paper.pdf#:~:text=obtaining%20finite,can%20also%20be%20worked%20out). More general Lyapunov conditions such as  $\dot V \le -\alpha\sqrt{V}$  yield  $T_{\rm reach} \le 2\sqrt{V(0)}/\alpha$ [control.dii.unisi.it](https://control.dii.unisi.it/anc/pdf/Sliding_mode.pdf#:~:text=%283,9), but when  $V=\tfrac12 s^2$  this simplifies to the same bound.
    
3.  **Design implications:** The reaching‑law gain  $\eta$  (or  $k$ ) controls the hitting time. A larger  $\eta$  yields faster convergence but may increase chattering and actuator wear. The finite‑time bound allows designers to choose gains to meet performance and robustness requirements.
    

These results highlight that **sliding‑mode control is distinguished by finite‑time convergence to the sliding surface**, in contrast to many classical controllers which provide only asymptotic convergence. The explicit hitting‑time formulas derived in the cited works form the theoretical foundation for reaching‑law design in modern sliding‑mode control.
