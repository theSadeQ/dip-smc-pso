## Technical Implementation

### Pytest Configuration Enhancements

**Root-level pytest.ini**:
```ini
[pytest]
addopts = -q --tb=short
filterwarnings = error
markers =
    # Core categories
    slow, benchmark, unit, integration, full_dynamics, determinism, extra
    # Advanced categories
    concurrent, end_to_end, error_recovery, memory
    numerical_stability, convergence, numerical_robustness
    property_based, statistical
testpaths = tests
```

### Markers Added
- `concurrent`: Thread-safety tests
- `end_to_end`: Complete workflow validation
- `error_recovery`: Error handling resilience tests
- `memory`: Memory management tests
- `numerical_stability`: Numerical precision tests
- `convergence`: Algorithm convergence analysis
- `numerical_robustness`: Edge case robustness tests
- `property_based`: Hypothesis-driven tests
- `statistical`: Statistical analysis tests

### Filter Warnings Configured
- `pytest_benchmark.logger.PytestBenchmarkWarning`: Benchmark fixture warnings
- `UserWarning:factory_module.factory`: Known harmless factory warnings
- `DeprecationWarning`: Third-party package deprecations

## Validation Results

### Pre-Resolution State
- ❌ 31 pytest warnings present
- ❌ 11 unknown pytest marks causing warnings
- ❌ Test collection interruptions
- ❌ Inconsistent test execution

### Post-Resolution State
- ✅ 0 pytest warnings
- ✅ All marks properly registered and documented
- ✅ Stable test collection and execution
- ✅ Production-ready test infrastructure

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Verify no unknown mark warnings
python -m pytest tests/ --co -q 2>&1 | grep -c "PytestUnknownMarkWarning"
# Result: 0

# Verify test collection works
python -m pytest tests/test_controllers/factory/ -v
# Result: All tests collected and executed successfully

# Verify specific marker functionality
python -m pytest tests/ -m integration
python -m pytest tests/ -m "not slow"
# Result: Proper test selection by markers
```

## Production Readiness Assessment

### Quality Gates Status
