 Great work identifying surface divergence as the root cause (100% rate)!

  Can you develop a theoretical proof explaining WHY the Hybrid STA sliding surface cannot converge for the double-inverted pendulum?

  Consider:
  1. Sliding surface definition: s = λ₁e₁ + ė₁ + λ₂e₂ + ė₂
  2. DIP dynamics: Extreme nonlinearity, coupled pendulums
  3. Super-twisting assumptions: Bounded uncertainties
  4. Lyapunov analysis: Prove s cannot reach/stay at 0

  This would complete the research: empirical evidence (your 100% result) + theoretical proof (why it's impossible).
